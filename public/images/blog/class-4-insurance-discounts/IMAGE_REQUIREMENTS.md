## Tips for Adding Images

1. **Optimize file sizes:**
   - Keep under 500KB each for fast page load
   - Use tools like TinyJPG or Squoosh.app to compress

2. **Use exact filenames:**
   - Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - `hero-insurance-savings.jpg` NOT `Hero-Insurance-Savings.jpg`

3. **Professional quality matters:**
   - These posts target homeowners making $15k+ decisions
   - Clear, high-quality photos build trust
   - Avoid blurry or low-resolution images

4. **Test after adding:**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/blog/class-4-shingles-insurance-discounts-texas
   - Verify all images load and look good

5. **Stock photos acceptable:**
   - If you don't have specific photos, high-quality stock photos are fine
   - Sites: Unsplash, Pexels (free commercial use)
   - Search terms: "roof hail damage" "insurance documents" "roofing shingles"
