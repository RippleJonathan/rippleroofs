## ✅ Citations You've Already Set Up (Keep As-Is)

### 1. **Yelp** (DA 95)
- **Status:** ✅ Set up, FREE listing
- **Your Question:** "I don't pay for ads, is that okay?"
- **Answer:** YES! You don't need paid ads. The free business listing is all you need for the backlink and local SEO value. Paid ads are for more customer visibility, NOT required for SEO.
- **Action:** None. Keep profile updated with photos and respond to reviews.

### 2. **BBB.org** (DA 85+)
- **Status:** ✅ Listed but stopped paying for accreditation
- **Your Question:** "We stopped paying $70/month for accredited status, but it looks like it's still linked to us"

### 3. **LinkedIn Company Page** (DA 98)
- **Status:** ✅ Set up last week

- **Action:** Wait 2-3 more weeks, then check Google Search Console external links report.

### 4. **Thumbtack** (DA 80)
- **Status:** ✅ You say you're on it
- **Your Question:** "We are on Thumbtack actually, I'm surprised it's not showing up"
- **Answer:** Likely just hasn't been crawled yet OR your Thumbtack profile doesn't link back to rippleroofs.com properly.
- **Action:** 
  1. Go to your Thumbtack profile settings
  2. Make sure your website link is: https://rippleroofs.com
  3. Make sure your profile is public and complete
  4. Check again in 2-4 weeks in Search Console

### 5. **Round Rock Chamber of Commerce**
- **Status:** ✅ Just paid $300 membership
- **Answer:** EXCELLENT investment! They should add you to their online member directory within 1-2 weeks. This is a high-quality local backlink (DA 40-50+).
- **Action:** 
  1. Check if you received member portal login credentials

- Common roofing scams to avoid after storms  

I can provide:
✓ Expert quotes (on or off the record)

✓ Data on common roofing issues in Round Rock
✓ Quick turnaround for time-sensitive stories

Would love to be a resource for future stories. Happy to chat by phone anytime.

Best,

Subject: Story Idea: Why Newer Central Texas Homes Keep Getting Roof Damage

Hi [Reporter Name],

I saw your excellent coverage of local issues affecting Central Texas homeowners. I'm a roofing contractor in Round Rock, and I've noticed a concerning trend that might make a good story.

Story idea: "Why are roofs on newer homes (built 2015-2020) failing more frequently than older homes in Central Texas?"

The angle:
- We're seeing 2-3x more claims on homes built in the last 5-10 years vs. homes from the 90s/2000s
- Likely causes: Cheaper materials during building boom, inadequate ventilation, installation shortcuts
- Homeowners feel "robbed" paying for roof replacement on 5-year-old homes
- This affects Round Rock, Georgetown, Leander significantly

I can provide:
✓ Real local examples (with homeowner permission)
✓ Cost comparisons showing the impact
✓ Expert analysis of why this is happening
✓ Tips for buyers/sellers on evaluating roof quality

This ties into the housing boom story and affects thousands of Central Texas families.

Interested in exploring this?

Subject: Business Angle: How Stone-Coated Steel Roofing Is Disrupting Central Texas Market

Hi [Business Editor],

Quick business trend story idea for ABJ:

"New roofing material capturing 15-20% of Central Texas replacement market"

The story:
- Stone-coated steel roofing (looks like tile, performs like metal) growing rapidly in Austin metro
- Driven by: Frequent hail, HOA restrictions, energy costs
- Creates new market segment: Homeowners willing to pay 2-3x for "lifetime" roof
- Local contractors seeing revenue shift toward premium products

Business angles:
✓ Market size: $50M+ annually in Central Texas
✓ Job creation: Specialized installers needed
✓ Supply chain: Local distributors carrying new products
✓ Consumer behavior: Why homeowners spend $35k on roof instead of $15k

I run a local roofing company and can share real market data, customer trends, and revenue impacts.

Think this fits ABJ's audience?

- **Most agents have resource pages:** "My Preferred Vendors" or "Trusted Contractors"
- **Target:** Agents you've worked with 3+ times

### Builders & General Contractors
- **If you subcontract for builders/GCs, ask for vendor page link**
- **Trade: You link to them, they link to you**

### Satisfied Customers (High-Value Homes)
- **Politely ask:** "We'd be honored if you mentioned us on your Nextdoor account or Facebook"
