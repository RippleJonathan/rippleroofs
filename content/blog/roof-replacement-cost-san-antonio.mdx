## Factors That Determine Your Roof Replacement Cost

### 1. Roof Size (Square Footage)

Roofing contractors measure in 'squares' (100 square feet). A 2,000 sq ft home typically has 2,200-2,400 sq ft of roof surface (accounting for pitch/slope).

**San Antonio Home Size Breakdown:**
| Home Size | Roof Squares | Typical Cost Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1,200-1,500 sq ft | 14-18 squares | $10,500-$15,000 |
| 1,500-2,000 sq ft | 18-24 squares | $13,000-$19,000 |

| 3,000-4,000 sq ft | 36-48 squares | $25,000-$38,000 |

## Ways to Save Money on Roof Replacement

### 1. File Insurance Claim for Storm Damage

**Biggest Money Saver:**
If you have legitimate hail or wind damage from recent storms, insurance should cover replacement. 

**What's Covered:**
- Hail damage (circular impacts, granule loss)
- Wind damage (missing/torn shingles)
- Tree damage from storms
- Typically full replacement if damage is widespread

**What's NOT Covered:**
- Normal wear and tear
- Age-related deterioration
- Poor maintenance
- Cosmetic issues only

**San Antonio Tip:** Check storm dates against your roof condition. Major hail events in 2024: Feb 28, April 9, May 15, Oct 12. If your roof looks damaged and dates match, file a claim.

### 2. Choose Off-Peak Season

**Best Times:**
- **Fall** (October-November): Ideal weather, less demand
- **Winter** (December-February): Slowest season, best discounts (10-20% off)

**Avoid:**
- **Spring/Summer** (March-August): Peak season, highest prices, longest wait times

**Savings:** $1,500-$3,500 by scheduling in winter

### 3. Get Multiple Quotes (But Be Smart)

**Best Practice:**
- Get 3-5 written estimates
- Compare scope of work, not just price
- Lowest bid often means shortcuts

**Red Flags:**
- Price more than 30% below others (cutting corners)
- No written contract
- Large upfront payment required (&gt;10%)
- Pressure to sign immediately

**Savings:** Comparing quotes can save $2,000-$5,000

### 4. Choose the Right Material

**Class 4 Impact-Resistant Shingles:**
- Cost +$3,000-$5,000 more than standard
- BUT: Insurance discounts 20-35% annually
- Payback period: 5-7 years
- **Then save money every year for life of roof**

**Example:**
- Upgrade cost: +$4,000
- Annual insurance savings: $600/year
- Break-even: 6.7 years
- Roof lifespan: 30 years
- **Total savings: $18,000-$24,000 over roof life**

### 5. Bundle Work

**Combine Projects:**
- Roof + gutters: Save $300-$600
- Roof + attic insulation: Save $400-$800
- Roof + solar panels: Coordinate timing (roof first!)

**One Contract Savings:** Contractors offer discounts for larger jobs

### 6. Financing Options

**If paying cash isn't feasible:**
- Home equity line of credit: 6-9% interest
- Personal loan: 8-15% interest
- Contractor financing: 0% for 12-18 months often available
- Credit card: Last resort (18-25% interest)

**Avoid:** 'Pay no deductible' offers (insurance fraud, illegal)

## Insurance Claims: What San Antonio Homeowners Need to Know

### Texas-Specific Rules

**1-Year Filing Deadline:**
You must file insurance claims within **1 year of storm date** in Texas. Document every major hail/wind event.

**Statute of Limitations:**
You have up to 2 years to file lawsuit if claim is unfairly denied, but best to file claim within 1 year.

### Common Insurance Issues in San Antonio

**Claim Denials:**
- 'Cosmetic damage only' (hail dents but no functional impact)
- 'Wear and tear' (even if storm damage exists)
- 'Wind-driven rain' exclusion (leak claims)
- 'Matching shingles not covered' (discontinued colors)

**How to Fight Denials:**
1. Get independent inspection from certified roofer
2. Provide documentation: photos, storm dates, expert opinion
3. File supplement with additional evidence
4. Hire public adjuster if needed (10-15% of settlement)
5. File complaint with Texas Department of Insurance

### Typical Settlement Process

**Timeline:**
1. **File claim:** Same day as damage discovery
2. **Adjuster visit:** 3-14 days
3. **Initial estimate:** 7-21 days
4. **Negotiate/supplement:** 1-4 weeks
5. **Final approval:** 2-8 weeks total

**Payment:**
- Usually 2 payments: **ACV (Actual Cash Value)** upfront, **RCV (Replacement Cost Value)** after completion
- **Deductible:** $1,000-$2,500 typical (you pay this)
- **Example:** $20,000 roof, $1,500 deductible
  - Insurance ACV payment: $12,000 (depreciated value)
  - You pay: $1,500 deductible + difference until completion
  - Insurance RCV payment: $6,500 after work complete
  - **Your total cost: $1,500**

**Q: Will insurance pay for my new roof?**
A: Insurance covers roof replacement if you have storm damage (hail, wind, fallen trees) from recent events. Normal wear and tear is not covered. Must file claim within 1 year of storm date in Texas. Deductible applies ($1,000-$2,500 typical).

**Q: How long does roof replacement take?**
A: Most San Antonio homes take 1-3 days. Standard 2,000 sq ft home: 1 day for shingles, 2-3 days for metal roofing. Larger/complex roofs: 3-5 days. Weather delays can extend timeline.

**Q: What's the best time to replace a roof in San Antonio?**
A: Fall (October-November) and winter (December-February) are ideal—cooler temperatures, better shingle adhesion, lower demand means better pricing (save 10-20%). Avoid summer peak season if possible.

**Q: Should I get impact-resistant shingles?**
A: Highly recommended for San Antonio. Class 4 impact-resistant shingles cost $3,000-$5,000 more but provide 20-35% insurance discounts. Payback period: 5-7 years, then you save money every year. Better hail protection too.

**Q: Can I reroof over existing shingles?**
A: Texas allows maximum 2 layers. If you have 1 layer, you *can* reroof over, but not recommended—hidden damage, reduced lifespan, heavier load. Most contractors recommend complete tear-off for longest-lasting results.

**Q: How do I know if I have hail damage?**
A: Look for circular dents/bruises on shingles, granule loss (black spots showing through), cracked shingles, dented vents/gutters. Use binoculars from ground—don't climb on roof. Get professional inspection (free from us).

**Q: What's the difference between architectural and 3-tab shingles?**
A: Architectural shingles are thicker, more durable, better looking, longer lasting (25-30 vs. 15-20 years). Cost about 30% more but worth it. 3-tab shingles are largely obsolete—90% of new roofs use architectural.

**Q: Do I need a permit for roof replacement in San Antonio?**

**Q: How often should I replace my roof in San Antonio?**
A: Architectural shingles: 18-25 years. Impact-resistant shingles: 25-30 years. Metal roofing: 40-70 years. San Antonio's extreme heat shortens lifespan vs. cooler climates. Plan replacement at 20 years for shingles.
