### What color roof is best for Cedar Park?

**Most Popular (70% of homes):**
- **Weathered Wood** (medium brown)
- **Driftwood** (gray-brown blend)
- **Estate Gray** (medium gray)
- **Pewter Gray** (charcoal gray)

**Why These Colors:**
- ✅ HOA-approved in all neighborhoods
- ✅ Match Hill Country aesthetic
- ✅ Don't show dirt/debris
- ✅ Moderate heat absorption
- ✅ Timeless appearance

**Color Considerations:**

**Heat Reflection:**
- Light colors: 5-10% cooler attic
- Dark colors: Absorb more heat (but modern shingles mitigate this)
- Minimal difference with proper ventilation
- Choose aesthetics first, heat second

**Resale Value:**
- Neutral earth tones: Broadest appeal
- Bright/unusual colors: Limit buyer pool
- Match neighborhood: Safest choice

**Tree Coverage:**
- Heavy trees: Darker colors hide stains better
- Open sun: Any color works
- Algae-resistant features more important than color

**Our Recommendation:** Weathered Wood or Driftwood for most Cedar Park homes. Classic, HOA-friendly, timeless!

### Should I replace my roof before selling my Cedar Park home?

**Depends on roof condition:**

**Replace BEFORE selling if:**
- ✅ Roof is 20+ years old
- ✅ Visible damage or missing shingles
- ✅ Multiple layers (buyer's inspector will note)
- ✅ Curling, cracking, or granule loss
- ✅ You're in competitive price range ($400,000-$600,000)

**Why:**
- New roof = $15,000-$25,000 added value
- Attracts more buyers (financing easier)
- Eliminates negotiation point
- Shows home maintenance pride
- Appraisal comes in higher

**Don't replace if:**
- Roof is 10 years old or less (good condition)
- Budget limited (better spent elsewhere)
- Ultra-high-end home ($700,000+) where buyers expect to customize

**Alternative:**
- Get inspection report showing remaining life
- Offer credit to buyer ($10,000-$15,000)
- Price accordingly

**Cedar Park Market (2025):**
- Competitive in mid-price range ($350,000-$550,000)
- New roof significant differentiator
- Buyers don't want immediate projects
- Worth the investment in most cases

**Real Example:**
- Home listed at $465,000 (roof 23 years old)
- Offers: $445,000 with $12,000 roof credit requested
- Owner replaces roof: $16,000
- Re-lists: $479,000
- Sells: $475,000
- Net gain: $14,000 (plus faster sale)

### How much does decking replacement cost in Cedar Park homes?

**Depends on home age:**

**1980s Homes (Anderson Mill, Cypress Creek):**
- Expect: 20-40 sheets (25-50% of roof deck)
- Cost: $1,500-$3,000 additional
- Why: 40+ year old OSB/plywood deteriorates
- Also common: Sag in sections, water damage

**1990s Homes (Buttercup Creek, Carriage Hills):**
- Expect: 10-20 sheets (10-25% of roof deck)
- Cost: $750-$1,500 additional
- Why: 30+ years, tree damage common, spotty quality from builders

**2000s Homes (Whitestone, Twin Creeks):**
- Expect: 5-15 sheets (5-15% of roof deck)
- Cost: $400-$1,000 additional
- Why: Localized damage (branches, leaks), generally good condition

**2010s+ Homes (Preserve, newer sections):**
- Expect: 0-5 sheets (0-5% of roof deck)
- Cost: $0-$400 additional
- Why: Modern materials, minimal exposure, excellent condition

**Per Sheet Cost:**
- 4'x8' sheet: $50-$75 installed
- Includes: Material, removal, installation, disposal

**Hidden Until Removal:**
- Won't know exact amount until tear-off
- Reputable contractors: Estimate fairly, charge actual
- Get per-sheet price in writing
- Budget for it (especially older homes)

**Cedar Park Specific:**
- Clay soil foundation movement can stress decking
- Heavy tree coverage causes more damage (Buttercup Creek, Anderson Mill)
- Oak branches specifically problematic

**Our Advice:** Budget minimum $500-$1,000 extra for decking in any home 15+ years old in Cedar Park.

### Can I put solar panels on my Cedar Park roof?

**Yes, with considerations:**

**HOA Approval:**
- Most Cedar Park HOAs now allow solar (state law protection)
- May restrict: Visibility from street, placement, appearance
- Whitestone, Preserve, Twin Creeks: Usually approve
- Older neighborhoods without HOAs: No restrictions

**Roof Requirements:**
- South-facing roof area (ideal)
- Roof in good condition (15+ years life left)
- Minimal shading from trees
- Structural support adequate

**Best Approach:**
- **Option 1:** Replace roof + install solar together
  - Pro: Single project, roof warrantied under panels
  - Pro: No need to remove panels later
  - Cost: $30,000-$50,000 combined
  - Best for: Roofs 15+ years old

- **Option 2:** Solar-ready roof now, panels later
  - Pro: Spread out costs
  - Pro: Solar prices dropping
  - Add: Conduit runs, blocking during roof replacement
  - Cost: $15,000-$25,000 roof, $15,000-$25,000 solar later

- **Option 3:** Solar on newer roof
  - Pro: Roof lasts full life under panels
  - Con: Panels must be removed for future roof replacement ($2,000-$4,000)

**Cedar Park Specific:**
- Excellent sun exposure (most neighborhoods)
- Austin Energy solar rebates available
- 8-12 year payback typical
- Home values increase $15,000-$30,000

**Neighborhoods with High Solar Adoption:**
- Whitestone (modern, progressive)
- Preserve at Stone Oak Ranch
- Parts of Brushy Creek area

**Our Recommendation:** If your roof is 15+ years old and you're interested in solar, replace roof first (or together). If roof is 10 years old, wait and add solar now.
