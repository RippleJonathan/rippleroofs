# Round Rock Roof Insurance Claims Guide: How to Get Full Coverage After Hail Damage (2025)

Round Rock sits in the heart of "Hail Alley"—a zone experiencing some of Texas's most devastating hailstorms. After golf ball-sized hail hammers your neighborhood, insurance companies send adjusters who often miss damage, deny legitimate claims, or offer lowball settlements. As [Round Rock's CertainTeed Shingle Master certified roofing contractor](/locations/round-rock), we've helped over 1,000 homeowners successfully navigate insurance claims and recover millions in rightful coverage.

This comprehensive guide reveals exactly how to file, document, and win your Round Rock roof insurance claim in 2025.

## Understanding Round Rock's Hail Problem

### Recent Major Storm Events

Round Rock's location northwest of Austin creates a perfect storm pathway. Here are the hailstorms that devastated Round Rock roofs:

**March 2023 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Golf ball to tennis ball (1.75"-2.5" diameter)
- **Areas Hit**: All of Round Rock, especially Teravista, Forest Creek, Cat Hollow
- **Insurance Claims Filed**: 10,000+ in Round Rock alone
- **Average Claim Payout**: $15,000-$25,000
- **Outcome**: Most roofs needed full replacement

**May 2022 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Baseball-sized (2.75"+ diameter)
- **Areas Hit**: Eastern Round Rock (Chandler Creek, Forest Creek, Paloma Lake)
- **Insurance Claims Filed**: 5,000+ 
- **Average Claim Payout**: $18,000-$28,000
- **Outcome**: Catastrophic damage, many roofs totaled

**April 2021 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Softball-sized (4"+ diameter in some areas)
- **Areas Hit**: Northwestern Round Rock (Teravista, Walsh Ranch, Heritage Center)
- **Insurance Claims Filed**: 8,000+
- **Average Claim Payout**: $16,000-$30,000
- **Outcome**: Some Round Rock homeowners on 2nd or 3rd roof replacement due to repeated storms

**The Pattern**: Round Rock gets hammered by major hail every 1-2 years. If you haven't filed a claim yet, you likely have hidden damage that insurance will cover.

### Round Rock Neighborhoods Most Affected

**Highest Risk Areas**:
- **Teravista**: Wide-open terrain, minimal tree cover, direct storm path
- **Forest Creek**: Elevated location catches severe weather
- **Cat Hollow**: New development, exposed to hail corridor
- **Walsh Ranch**: Master-planned community hit in 2021, 2022, 2023
- **Heritage Center**: Mature neighborhood, older roofs vulnerable
- **Brushy Creek**: Historic area with storm-susceptible roofing

**Why This Matters for Claims**: If your neighbors filed claims, your roof likely has similar damage—even if you don't see obvious problems from the ground.

## What Round Rock Insurance Companies Actually Cover

### Covered Perils (What They WILL Pay For)

✅ **Hail Damage**
- Granule loss exposing asphalt substrate
- Fractured or cracked shingles
- Bruised/dented shingles (functional damage)
- Damaged flashing, vents, gutters, downspouts
- Broken roof penetrations (skylights, pipe boots)

✅ **Wind Damage**
- Missing shingles from high winds
- Lifted or curled shingles
- Torn or displaced flashing
- Damaged underlayment exposure
- Blown-off ridge caps

✅ **Combined Storm Damage**
- Hail + wind in same storm event
- Fallen tree limbs from storm
- Debris impact during severe weather
- Ice dam damage (from winter storms)

✅ **Full Replacement When**:
- Damage exceeds 40% of roof (most policies)
- Matching shingles unavailable (discontinued colors)
- Structural damage to decking
- Multiple storm events create cumulative damage

### NOT Covered (What They WON'T Pay For)

❌ **Normal Wear and Tear**
- Age-related deterioration
- UV degradation over time
- Granule loss from normal weathering
- Manufacturing defects (file with manufacturer)

❌ **Pre-Existing Damage**
- Damage from storms BEFORE your policy started
- Prior damage you didn't report
- Neglected repairs from past storms

❌ **Maintenance Issues**
- Lack of preventive maintenance
- Clogged gutters causing water damage
- Poor ventilation leading to premature failure
- DIY repairs done incorrectly

❌ **Cosmetic Damage Only** (Some Policies)
- **CRITICAL**: Some Round Rock policies have "cosmetic damage exclusions"
- Means hail dents that don't affect function may not be covered
- Check your policy declarations page
- Most Round Rock homeowners DON'T have these exclusions

### Round Rock-Specific Policy Considerations

**Typical Round Rock Deductibles**:
- **Percentage-Based**: 1-2% of dwelling coverage
  - $300,000 home = $3,000-$6,000 deductible
  - $400,000 home = $4,000-$8,000 deductible
- **Flat Deductible**: $2,500-$5,000 (less common)
- **Separate Wind/Hail**: Sometimes higher deductible just for wind/hail (check policy)

**Replacement Cost Value (RCV) vs Actual Cash Value (ACV)**:
- **RCV**: Insurance pays full replacement cost (what most Round Rock policies have)
  - Example: New roof costs $18,000, you pay $3,000 deductible, insurance pays $15,000
- **ACV**: Insurance pays depreciated value (rare but check your policy)
  - Example: 15-year-old roof worth $10,000 depreciated, insurance pays $7,000 after deductible
  - You're stuck with $11,000 out-of-pocket

**How Payment Works**:
1. **Initial Payment (ACV)**: Insurance pays depreciated amount upfront
   - Example: $18,000 claim, 20% depreciation = $14,400 initial check
2. **Final Payment (Recoverable Depreciation)**: After work completed, you submit invoice
   - Example: Submit $18,000 invoice, insurance pays remaining $3,600
3. **You Pay**: Your deductible ($3,000) at time of work completion

## Step-by-Step: Filing Your Round Rock Insurance Claim

### Step 1: Document Damage (First 48 Hours)

**Immediate Actions**:

**📸 Take Comprehensive Photos**:
- **From ground level** (DO NOT climb on roof—safety + liability)
- **All angles**: Front, back, sides, every elevation
- **Close-ups**: Dented gutters, damaged vents, window screens
- **Hail on ground**: If storm just passed, photograph hail with ruler/quarter for size reference
- **Neighboring damage**: Other homes with visible damage (strengthens "storm pattern" claim)
- **Interior damage**: Water stains, ceiling damage, attic leaks

**📝 Document Storm Details**:
- **Date and time** of hail event
- **Hail size** (check National Weather Service storm reports)
- **Save weather reports**: Screenshot/print National Weather Service data showing hail in Round Rock
- **News coverage**: Local news coverage of the storm
- **Neighbors**: Note if neighbors are filing claims (widespread damage = easier approval)

**🔍 Quick Self-Inspection**:
- Look for dented gutters/downspouts
- Check AC unit for hail dents
- Examine window screens for holes
- Look for damaged siding
- Check fence/deck for impact marks

**Round Rock Pro Tip**: After major hailstorms (like March 2023), insurance companies get FLOODED with claims. File within 7 days to avoid backlog delays.

### Step 2: Contact Your Insurance Company (Within 7 Days)

**Make the Call**:

**📞 What to Say**:
- "I need to file a claim for roof damage from the [DATE] hailstorm in Round Rock"
- "My address is [STREET], Round Rock, TX [ZIP]"
- "I have photos documenting damage to my roof, gutters, and property"
- "I'd like to schedule an adjuster inspection as soon as possible"

**📋 Information You'll Need**:
- Policy number
- Date of loss (storm date)
- Description of damage
- Contact information
- Preferred adjuster appointment times

**✅ Get This Information**:
- **Claim number** (write it down immediately)
- **Adjuster name and contact info**
- **Inspection timeline** (usually 3-14 days)
- **Your deductible amount**
- **Coverage details** (RCV vs ACV, any exclusions)

**⚠️ What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "I'm not sure if there's damage" (sounds uncertain)
- ❌ "My roof is old anyway" (gives them excuse to deny)
- ❌ "This happened a few months ago" (delayed reporting = red flag)
- ❌ Accept blame: "I should've maintained better" (admission of neglect)

### Step 3: Get Professional Inspection (Within 2 Weeks)

**Why You NEED a Contractor Inspection**:

Insurance adjusters work for the insurance company—their job is to minimize payouts. A professional roofing contractor works for YOU and finds ALL damage.

**What We Find That Adjusters "Miss"**:
- ✅ **Hidden hail impacts** on back slopes adjuster didn't photograph
- ✅ **Damaged decking** underneath shingles
- ✅ **Compromised flashing** around chimneys and valleys
- ✅ **Granule loss patterns** indicating functional damage
- ✅ **Damaged ridge vents and penetrations**
- ✅ **Bruised shingles** that will fail prematurely
- ✅ **Code violations** requiring upgrades (must be covered)

**Our Free Inspection Includes**:
1. **Complete roof assessment** (all slopes, penetrations, flashing)
2. **Thermal imaging** (detects hidden moisture from leaks)
3. **Drone photography** (comprehensive damage documentation)
4. **Written damage report** with photos
5. **Scope of work** (what needs repair/replacement)
6. **Detailed estimate** (itemized costs for insurance)
7. **Insurance meeting attendance** (we meet with your adjuster)

**Round Rock Contractor Selection**:

✅ **Choose Local, Established Contractors**:
- Permanent Round Rock/Austin office
- CertainTeed Shingle Master or GAF Master Elite certified
- BBB A+ rating with local references
- Licensed/insured in Texas (verify TDLR license)
- Experienced with Round Rock insurance adjusters

❌ **AVOID Storm Chasers**:
- Out-of-state license plates (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana)
- Door-knocking within days of storm
- High-pressure "sign today" tactics
- Offering to "waive your deductible" (ILLEGAL insurance fraud)
- No local office/references
- Asking you to sign insurance check over to them
- Demanding payment before adjuster inspection

**Round Rock Storm Chaser Warning**: After the March 2023 hailstorm, Round Rock was FLOODED with storm chasers. Teravista, Forest Creek, and Walsh Ranch neighborhoods saw dozens of door-knockers. Many homeowners got burned—contractors disappeared after deposit, did shoddy work, or committed insurance fraud that voided coverage.

### Step 4: Meet the Insurance Adjuster (1-3 Weeks)

**Preparing for Adjuster Inspection**:

**📅 Schedule Strategically**:
- **Have YOUR contractor present** (levels the playing field—adjuster knows they can't lowball)
- **Mid-morning appointments** (9-11am—adjuster is fresh, not rushed)
- **Avoid Fridays** (adjusters rush to finish week)
- **Be present yourself** (shows you're engaged and watching)

**🏠 Property Preparation**:
- Clear driveway/yard access
- Unlock gates
- Secure pets
- Have ladder accessible (if safe)
- Print your damage photos for reference
- Have National Weather Service storm report handy

**What Happens During Inspection**:

**Adjuster's Process** (30-90 minutes):
1. Introduction and claim number verification
2. Exterior walkthrough noting visible damage
3. Roof access via ladder or drone
4. Photographs/measurements of damaged areas
5. Interior inspection (if leaks reported)
6. Notes on roof age, condition, prior repairs
7. Verbal assessment (often minimizing damage)

**Your Role**:
- ✅ **Be Professional**: Friendly but businesslike
- ✅ **Point Out Damage**: "The contractor found damage on the back slope too"
- ✅ **Show Your Photos**: "Here's the hail on the ground that day"
- ✅ **Reference Neighbors**: "Three homes on my street have filed claims"
- ✅ **Take Notes**: Write down what adjuster says
- ✅ **Get Timeline**: "When will I receive the estimate?"

**Common Round Rock Adjuster Tactics (And How to Counter)**:

❌ **Adjuster**: *"That's just normal granule loss from age."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"This happened during the [DATE] storm. Here's the National Weather Service report showing 2-inch hail in Round Rock that day. My contractor documented functional damage, not just cosmetic wear."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"Your roof is 15 years old, so we'll only pay depreciated value."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"My policy includes Replacement Cost Value coverage. Age doesn't matter when storm damage is the cause of loss. I expect full replacement cost minus deductible."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"I only see minor damage on the front slope. We'll approve a repair, not replacement."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"My contractor found damage on all slopes. Let's review the back slope together. Also, if matching shingles aren't available, the policy requires full replacement for aesthetic match."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"We need to see 8-10 hail impacts per 10x10 square for approval."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"My policy doesn't state a specific threshold. Functional damage from even one impact per square can compromise the roof's integrity. Please document all impacts."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"This looks like wear and tear, not storm damage."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"I can provide the exact storm date, weather service hail reports, and photos of neighboring properties with similar damage from the same event. This is clearly storm-related."*

**Round Rock Specific**: Round Rock adjusters are familiar with hail patterns in neighborhoods like Teravista and Forest Creek. If your neighbors filed claims for the same storm, mention it—adjusters can't deny your claim if they approved similar damage next door.

### Step 5: Review the Adjuster's Estimate (7-14 Days)

**What You'll Receive**:

**Adjuster's Report Includes**:
- Scope of damage (what they agreed to cover)
- Line-item costs (materials, labor, permits, etc.)
- Total claim amount
- Depreciation amount (if applicable)
- Recoverable depreciation (paid after work completed)
- Your deductible
- Payment breakdown

**Example Round Rock Claim Estimate**:

```
Total Roof Replacement Cost: $18,500
Less Depreciation (20%):     -$3,700
Actual Cash Value (ACV):     $14,800
Less Deductible (1%):        -$3,000
Initial Payment to You:      $11,800

After Work Completed:
Recoverable Depreciation:    +$3,700
Total You Receive:           $15,500
Your Out-of-Pocket:          $3,000 (deductible)
```

**Red Flags to Watch For**:

❌ **Estimate Too Low**:
- Compare to your contractor's estimate
- Round Rock average full replacement: $12,000-$25,000 depending on home size
- If adjuster says $8,000 for 2,500 sq ft home = WAY too low

❌ **Repair Instead of Replacement**:
- If damage covers >40% of roof, most policies require full replacement
- Partial repairs rarely work long-term in Round Rock's hail climate
- Matching discontinued shingles = impossible = full replacement required

❌ **Missing Items**:
- Did adjuster include damaged gutters, vents, flashing?
- Permit costs?
- Dumpster/disposal fees?
- Decking repairs if needed?
- Waste factor (typically 10% for hips/valleys)?

❌ **Undercounting Damage**:
- Did they measure entire roof or just one slope?
- Round Rock homes average 20-30 squares—does estimate match?
- Ask contractor to verify square footage

### Step 6: File a Supplement (If Needed)

**What is a Supplement?**

A supplement is additional documentation submitted when the adjuster's initial estimate missed damage or undervalued the claim.

**Common Reasons for Supplements in Round Rock**:

1. **Hidden Damage Discovered During Tearoff**:
   - Rotten decking underneath shingles
   - Water damage to underlayment
   - Damaged roof framing
   - Code violations requiring upgrades

2. **Adjuster Missed Damage**:
   - Back slopes not inspected
   - Damage to outbuildings (garage, shed)
   - Gutter/downspout replacement needed
   - Additional flashing/penetration damage

3. **Price Discrepancies**:
   - Adjuster used low-quality materials in estimate
   - Labor rates below Round Rock market rates
   - Didn't include waste factor or steep slope charges
   - Missed permit fees ($150-$300 in Round Rock)

**How to File Supplement**:

1. **Contractor Documents Additional Damage**:
   - Photos during tearoff showing hidden issues
   - Detailed notes on extent of damage
   - Revised scope of work
   - Updated estimate with line items

2. **Submit to Insurance**:
   - Email or fax to adjuster
   - Include claim number
   - Reference original estimate
   - Itemize NEW damage found
   - Provide supporting photos

3. **Adjuster Re-Inspects** (or approves remotely):
   - Usually 3-7 days for review
   - May require second site visit
   - Approval depends on documentation quality

4. **Revised Payment Issued**:
   - Supplemental payment covers additional approved items
   - Usually paid within 7-14 days of approval

**Round Rock Supplement Success Rate**: When properly documented with photos and expert contractor assessment, supplements in Round Rock have a 75-85% approval rate. Insurance companies know Round Rock roofs get hammered—if you provide proof, they usually pay.

### Step 7: Complete the Work and Collect Final Payment

**Timeline**:

1. **Receive ACV Payment** (initial check from insurance)
2. **Sign Contract with Contractor** (reputable Round Rock roofer)
3. **Work Scheduled** (typically 2-6 weeks out depending on season)
4. **Roof Replaced** (1-3 days for average Round Rock home)
5. **Final Inspection** (city of Round Rock inspection for permit compliance)
6. **Submit Invoice to Insurance** (contractor provides completed work invoice)
7. **Receive RCV Payment** (recoverable depreciation released)
8. **Pay Contractor Final Balance** (you pay deductible + any overages)

**Payment Best Practices**:

✅ **DO**:
- Wait for insurance approval before signing contracts
- Pay deductible at time of work completion (not before)
- Get lien waivers from contractor and all subcontractors
- Keep all invoices, receipts, permits, warranties
- Submit RCV claim with signed completion certificate

❌ **DON'T**:
- Sign insurance check over to contractor (you control funds)
- Pay full amount upfront (standard is 1/3 deposit, balance at completion)
- Skip city inspection (required for permit closure)
- Let contractor leave without final walkthrough
- Forget to get written warranty (materials + workmanship)

## Common Round Rock Claim Denials (And How to Fight Them)

### Denial Reason #1: "Pre-Existing Damage"

**What They Say**:  
*"This damage existed before the storm event. Claim denied."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Provide storm date and National Weather Service hail reports
- ✅ Show photos of neighbors' damage from same storm
- ✅ Get expert opinion from contractor (letter stating damage is storm-related)
- ✅ Reference recent roof inspection (if you had one pre-storm showing no damage)
- ✅ Appeal with documentation proving damage timeline

**Round Rock Example**: After March 2023 hailstorm, some adjusters claimed damage was "from the 2021 storm." Homeowners fought back with photos taken AFTER 2021 storm showing no damage, plus weather service confirmation of March 2023 golf ball hail. Most denials overturned.

### Denial Reason #2: "Cosmetic Damage Only"

**What They Say**:  
*"We see hail dents, but they're cosmetic. Your policy excludes cosmetic damage."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Review your policy—most Round Rock homeowners DON'T have cosmetic exclusions
- ✅ Get contractor letter explaining functional damage (granule loss = shortened lifespan = functional)
- ✅ Document that matching shingles aren't available (aesthetic match impossible = functional issue)
- ✅ Cite Texas Insurance Code requirements for proper coverage

**Key Argument**: Hail damage that exposes asphalt substrate or fractures shingle seal strips is FUNCTIONAL damage, not cosmetic. Cosmetic = purely aesthetic with no impact on performance.

### Denial Reason #3: "Roof Too Old / Normal Wear"

**What They Say**:  
*"Your roof is 15 years old. This is normal wear and tear, not storm damage."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Confirm you have RCV (Replacement Cost Value) coverage, not ACV
- ✅ RCV policies cover storm damage regardless of age
- ✅ Get before-and-after documentation (storm created NEW damage, not wear)
- ✅ Expert opinion: Contractor explains this is storm damage, not age-related failure
- ✅ Texas law: Age doesn't void coverage for covered perils

**Round Rock Reality**: Many Round Rock roofs are 10-20 years old due to repeated hailstorms replacing roofs in cycles. Age doesn't matter if you have RCV coverage and can prove storm damage.

### Denial Reason #4: "Not Enough Damage"

**What They Say**:  
*"We only found 3 hail impacts. Not enough to warrant replacement."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Your contractor likely found MORE damage (have them document every impact)
- ✅ Request adjuster re-inspect with YOUR contractor present
- ✅ Cite policy—most don't have "minimum impact" threshold
- ✅ Argue: Even limited impacts on critical areas (valleys, penetrations) = functional damage
- ✅ If shingles discontinued, entire roof must be replaced for match

**Counter-Argument**: "My policy doesn't specify a threshold for approval. Hail damage to ANY portion of the roof compromises its integrity and warranty. Additionally, matching my discontinued shingles for a partial repair is impossible, requiring full replacement per policy provisions."

## When to Hire a Public Adjuster in Round Rock

**What is a Public Adjuster?**

A licensed professional who represents YOU (not the insurance company) in negotiating your claim. They handle all paperwork, documentation, and negotiations for a percentage of your settlement (typically 10-15%).

**When to Consider Hiring One**:

✅ **Claim Denied Unfairly**:
- You have clear storm damage but claim denied
- Multiple appeals rejected
- Insurance acting in bad faith

✅ **Very Large Claim** ($30,000+):
- Complex damage (roof + interior + structure)
- Multiple structures (home + garage + fence)
- 10-15% fee worth it for maximizing large payout

✅ **Time Constraints**:
- You're traveling/relocated
- Don't have time for back-and-forth
- Want expert to handle everything

✅ **Lowball Settlement**:
- Adjuster offering $8,000 for damage contractor estimates at $20,000
- Negotiations stalled
- You need leverage

**When You DON'T Need One**:

❌ **Straightforward Claim**:
- Clear hail damage, no disputes
- Adjuster approved fair amount
- Just need contractor to do work

❌ **Small Claim** ($5,000-$10,000):
- 10-15% fee ($500-$1,500) not worth it
- You can handle yourself or with contractor help

❌ **Good Contractor Support**:
- Your roofer is experienced with claims
- They attend adjuster meeting
- They file supplements for you (often free service)

**Round Rock Public Adjusters** (If You Need One):
- Verify Texas Department of Insurance license
- Check BBB rating and Google reviews
- Get fee structure in writing (percentage vs flat fee)
- Understand what services included
- Ask for Round Rock references

## Round Rock Insurance Claim Timeline & Expectations

**Typical Timeline** (Hail Damage Claim):

| Timeframe | Milestone |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Day 0** | Hailstorm hits Round Rock |
| **Days 1-7** | Document damage, call insurance, schedule contractor inspection |
| **Days 3-14** | Adjuster inspection scheduled |
| **Days 7-21** | Adjuster submits estimate |
| **Days 10-30** | Review estimate, file supplement if needed |
| **Days 21-45** | Claim approved, receive ACV payment |
| **Days 30-90** | Schedule and complete roof replacement |
| **Days 90-120** | Submit RCV claim, receive final payment |

**Total Time: 3-4 months from storm to final payment** (if no complications)

**Delays Common in Round Rock**:
- **After major storms**: When 5,000-10,000 claims filed simultaneously (like March 2023), adjuster visits delay 3-6 weeks
- **Supplement negotiations**: Can add 2-4 weeks
- **Contractor availability**: Peak season (spring/summer after hail) = 4-8 week wait
- **Permit delays**: City of Round Rock inspections sometimes delayed during high-volume periods

- Multiple angles of each damaged area
- Close-ups with ruler showing impact size
- Before-and-after comparisons (if available)

- Deductible amount (percentage or flat fee)
- Coverage limits (usually full replacement up to dwelling coverage)
- Exclusions (cosmetic damage clause? read carefully)
- Time limits for filing (usually 1 year, but file ASAP)

### Strategy #3: Use Local Expert Contractor

- Take notes
- Review estimates carefully
- Follow up regularly
- Don't sign anything until you understand it

### Strategy #5: File Supplements Strategically

📝 **Additional Damage**:
- Hidden damage during tearoff
- Code upgrade requirements
- Additional structures (garage, shed)
- Interior damage (water stains, drywall)
- Gutters, downspouts, flashing

### Strategy #6: Don't Accept First Offer

💰 **Negotiate**:
- Compare adjuster estimate to contractor estimate
- Point out discrepancies
- Request re-inspection
- Provide additional documentation
- Be professional but firm

## Round Rock Claim Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long to File

**The Problem**:
- Some policies have strict time limits (90 days to 1 year)
- Storm chasers move on, legitimate contractors get booked up
- Damage worsens over time (small leak becomes big problem)
- Evidence disappears (hail melts, neighbors fix roofs, photos lost)

**Round Rock Reality**: After March 2023 hailstorm, homeowners who waited 6+ months faced delays, contractor shortages, and tougher adjuster scrutiny.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Getting Professional Inspection

**The Problem**:
- You miss hidden damage
- Adjuster finds "nothing wrong" because you can't point out technical issues
- You accept lowball settlement not knowing true extent of damage
- Claim denied because "no damage found"

**Solution**: Free professional inspection from certified Round Rock roofer BEFORE adjuster visit.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Signing Insurance Check Over to Contractor

**The Problem**:
- You lose control of funds
- If contractor disappears, you have no leverage
- If dispute arises, you can't withhold payment
- Some contractors overcharge knowing they control money

**Proper Process**: Insurance check goes to YOU (or you + mortgage company). You pay contractor at milestones (deposit, completion).

### ❌ Mistake #4: Hiring Storm Chaser

**The Problem**:
- Shoddy work (they're gone before you notice)
- Insurance fraud (waiving deductible = illegal)
- No warranty support (can't find them later)
- Unlicensed/uninsured (liability falls on you)

**Round Rock Storm Chaser Red Flags**:
- Door-knocking immediately after storm
- Out-of-state plates (Oklahoma, Arkansas common)
- Pressure tactics: "Sign today or lose opportunity"
- "We'll waive your deductible" (ILLEGAL)
- No local office, P.O. box address
- Can't provide local references

### ❌ Mistake #5: Accepting Repair When Replacement Needed

**The Problem**:
- Partial repair on damaged roof = band-aid
- Matching shingles often unavailable (aesthetics + warranty issues)
- Repaired section fails faster than rest of roof
- You pay deductible for temporary fix

**Round Rock Truth**: With hail damage to 40%+ of roof, replacement is almost always better long-term value.

### ❌ Mistake #6: Not Reading Settlement Before Signing

**The Problem**:
- You sign away rights to future claims on same damage
- You accept depreciation when you have RCV coverage
- You don't notice missing items or lowball pricing
- Release-of-liability clauses prevent supplements

**Always**:
- Read entire settlement document
- Compare to contractor estimate
- Ask questions about anything unclear
- Don't sign under pressure
- Consult contractor or attorney if uncertain

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long do I have to file a claim after a Round Rock hailstorm?**

Most policies allow 1 year from date of loss, but file within 7-14 days for best results. After major Round Rock hailstorms, adjusters get backlogged—early filing = faster service.

**Will my insurance rates go up if I file a claim?**

Typically no. Hail is a "no-fault" natural disaster. However, check with your agent. Filing multiple claims in 3-5 years MAY affect rates or insurability. But don't let fear of rate increases stop you from filing legitimate claims—that's why you pay premiums.

**What if my adjuster says I don't have enough damage?**

Request a second inspection with YOUR contractor present. Get written documentation from contractor. File a formal appeal with photos and expert opinion. If still denied unfairly, hire public adjuster or consult insurance attorney.

**Can I choose my own contractor, or do I have to use insurance company's preferred vendor?**

YOU choose your contractor. Insurance cannot require you to use their "preferred vendor" list. Those contractors may cut corners to meet insurance pricing. Choose based on quality, certifications (CertainTeed Shingle Master), and local reputation.

**What if my roof is 20 years old? Will insurance still pay?**

If you have Replacement Cost Value (RCV) coverage, yes. Age doesn't matter for storm damage claims. If you only have Actual Cash Value (ACV) coverage, they'll depreciate based on age. Check your policy declarations page.

**Should I tarp my roof after storm damage?**

If actively leaking, yes—temporary tarp prevents further damage. Save receipts (insurance may reimburse tarping costs). But don't attempt yourself—hire professional to avoid injury and liability.

**How much will my deductible be?**

Check your policy. Most Round Rock homeowners have 1-2% of dwelling coverage:
- $300,000 home = $3,000-$6,000 deductible
- $400,000 home = $4,000-$8,000 deductible

Some policies have flat deductibles ($2,500, $5,000). Separate wind/hail deductibles sometimes higher.

**What's the difference between ACV and RCV payments?**

- **ACV (Actual Cash Value)**: Depreciated amount paid upfront
- **RCV (Replacement Cost Value)**: Full replacement cost (ACV + recoverable depreciation paid after work completed)

Most Round Rock policies are RCV. You receive ACV initially, submit invoice after completion, receive remaining depreciation.

**Don't Let Insurance Companies Shortchange You**

Round Rock homeowners pay thousands in premiums every year. When hail destroys your roof, you deserve full coverage. With proper documentation, expert contractor support, and knowledge of your rights, you can maximize your claim and get the quality roof replacement you're entitled to.
