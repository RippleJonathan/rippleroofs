Stone-coated steel roofing is the premium hybrid roofing material that Texas homeowners choose when they want metal's 50-year performance in a traditional tile or shake appearance—without the weight, cost, or HOA restrictions of concrete tile or the modern look of standing seam metal.

It's steel panels coated with crushed stone granules, combining the best of both worlds: metal's durability, hail resistance, and energy efficiency with traditional aesthetics that satisfy HOAs and complement Spanish, Mediterranean, craftsman, and traditional home styles.

In Texas, where 100°F+ summer heat, severe hailstorms, and strict HOA architectural guidelines are the norm, stone-coated steel metal roofing solves problems that other materials can't. It reflects heat like metal (cutting cooling costs 15-20%), withstands golf ball-sized hail without breaking, weighs 85% less than concrete tile, and looks so traditional that most HOAs don't even realize it's metal.

This is your complete guide: what stone-coated steel roofing is, how much it costs in Texas, how it performs in our climate, which brands to consider (Decra, Gerard, Metro Tiles, Boral), and whether the premium price is worth it.

## What Is Stone-Coated Steel Metal Roofing?

Stone-coated steel metal roofing is a hybrid product that combines a steel substrate with a stone granule finish, creating a roofing material that performs like metal but looks like traditional roofing.

**Construction Layers (Bottom to Top):**

1. **Galvalume or Zincalume-coated steel core** - 24-26 gauge steel panel (same thickness as quality standing seam metal)
2. **Aluminum-zinc protective coating** - Corrosion resistance layer (prevents rust)
3. **Acrylic base coat** - Adhesion primer for stone granules
4. **Stone granule layer** - Crushed basalt rock chips embedded in acrylic (same material as asphalt shingles)
5. **Acrylic overglaze topcoat** - Clear UV-resistant seal that locks in granules and adds weather protection

**The Result:**
A roofing panel that's 95% steel structurally (for strength, lifespan, and metal performance) with a stone granule finish that looks identical to traditional tile, cedar shake, or dimensional shingles from ground level.

**Weight Comparison:**
- Stone-coated steel: 1.3-1.7 lbs per square foot
- Asphalt shingles: 2.0-3.5 lbs per square foot  
- Standing seam metal: 0.7-1.2 lbs per square foot
- Concrete tile: 9-12 lbs per square foot
- Clay tile: 8-15 lbs per square foot

**Available Profiles:**
- **Tile profile** - Mediterranean, Spanish, Tuscan, Mission barrel tile appearance
- **Shake profile** - Cedar shake, wood shake rustic appearance  
- **Shingle profile** - Dimensional asphalt shingle appearance
- **Slate profile** - Natural slate stone appearance

**Why It Was Invented:**
Stone-coated steel was created in New Zealand in the 1950s to solve the aesthetic objection to bare metal roofing. Many homeowners wanted metal's longevity and performance but didn't like the industrial appearance. HOAs shared this concern and often prohibited metal roofing.

Stone-coated steel delivers metal performance in a traditional package that:
- Satisfies HOA architectural committees (looks traditional, not industrial)
- Complements traditional home styles (Spanish, Mediterranean, craftsman)
- Appeals to homeowners who want metal benefits without metal appearance
- Weighs less than tile (no structural reinforcement needed)
- Costs less than concrete tile while lasting as long

## Stone-Coated Steel Performance in Texas Climate

### Texas Heat Performance

**Texas Summer Reality:**
- 100°F+ temperatures June-September
- 105-110°F heat waves common
- Roof surface temps 160-190°F on asphalt
- Attic temps 140-160°F without proper roofing

**Stone-Coated Steel Heat Performance:**

**Solar Reflectance:**
- Reflects 30-50% of solar energy (varies by color)
- Stone granule coating absorbs some heat (like asphalt)
- Steel substrate underneath reflects radiant heat
- Better than asphalt, not as good as bare standing seam

**Attic Temperature Reduction:**
- 15-25°F cooler attic vs dark asphalt shingles
- 10-15°F cooler vs light-colored asphalt
- 5-10°F warmer than standing seam with cool coating

**Energy Savings in Texas:**
- 15-20% cooling cost reduction vs asphalt shingles
- Annual savings: $300-$600 on typical Texas home
- 30-year energy savings: $9,000-$18,000
- Helps offset premium installation cost

**Best Colors for Texas Heat:**
- Light tan/beige: Best reflectance (SRI 50-60)
- Light gray: Excellent (SRI 45-55)
- Terra cotta/clay: Good (SRI 35-45)
- Medium browns: Moderate (SRI 25-35)
- Dark colors: Least efficient (SRI 15-25)

**Heat Performance Comparison:**
1. Standing seam metal (cool coating): 25-30% energy savings
2. Stone-coated steel (light colors): 15-20% savings
3. Light asphalt shingles: 5-10% savings
4. Dark asphalt shingles: 0% (baseline)

### Texas Hail Performance (Critical)

Texas leads the nation in hail damage. Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston corridors experience frequent severe hailstorms.

**Stone-Coated Steel Hail Resistance:**

**Class 4 Impact Rating:**
- UL 2218 certified (highest impact rating)
- Withstands 2" steel ball dropped from 20 feet (testing standard)
- Survives golf ball to baseball-sized hail
- Stone granules absorb impact energy
- Steel substrate doesn't crack or break

**Real-World Texas Hail Performance:**
- Minor cosmetic denting from 1.5"+ diameter hail
- Rarely punctures or fails structurally
- Continues protecting home after hailstorm
- Often doesn't require replacement (unlike shingles)
- Insurance claims typically cosmetic only

**Hail Performance vs Other Materials:**

**After Severe Hailstorm:**
- Asphalt shingles: 60-80% require full replacement (granule loss, cracks)
- Standing seam metal: Cosmetic denting, rarely replaced
- Stone-coated steel: Minor denting, less than 5% replacement rate
- Concrete tile: 20-30% broken/cracked tiles need replacement

**Insurance Implications:**
- Class 4 rating qualifies for 20-35% premium discounts (most Texas insurers)
- Potential savings: $600-$1,500/year on insurance
- 30-year insurance savings: $18,000-$45,000
- Often offsets entire premium vs shingles

**Stone Granule Protection:**
The stone coating actually helps with hail:
- Distributes impact across larger surface area
- Absorbs some impact energy before reaching steel
- Quieter during hailstorm than bare metal
- May lose some granules on direct hits (cosmetic, doesn't affect performance)

### Wind Resistance

Texas experiences severe thunderstorm winds, hurricanes (coastal), and tornadoes.

**Stone-Coated Steel Wind Performance:**
- 120-140 mph wind ratings (varies by brand/profile)
- Mechanically fastened with corrosion-resistant screws
- Interlocking panels create continuous coverage
- Stone granules add weight (prevents uplift better than bare metal)
- Excellent wind performance (superior to shingles)

**Texas Storm Performance:**
Stone-coated roofs routinely survive severe Texas thunderstorms (60-80 mph winds) with zero damage while nearby asphalt roofs lose shingles.

### Lifespan in Texas Climate

**Expected Lifespan:**
- **Decra:** 50-60 years (potentially 70+ with proper maintenance)
- **Gerard:** 50-60 years
- **Metro/Boral:** 40-50 years

**What Affects Texas Lifespan:**

**Steel Substrate:** 50+ years (Galvalume/Zincalume coating prevents rust in Texas humidity)

**Stone Granules:** 30-40 years before slight thinning (doesn't affect performance, just aesthetics)

**Coating:** 25-30 years warranty, may fade slightly after but steel remains protected

**Comparison in Texas:**
- Stone-coated steel: 40-60 years
- Standing seam metal: 50-70 years
- Concrete tile: 50-100 years
- Class 4 shingles: 25-30 years (Texas heat shortens vs northern climates)
- Standard shingles: 18-22 years (Texas heat degrades petroleum base)

**Key Insight:**
Stone-coated steel will outlast 2-3 asphalt roof replacements in Texas, saving $25,000-$50,000 over its lifetime.

## Installation Process & Finding Qualified Contractors

### Stone-Coated Steel Installation Timeline

**Average Texas Home (2,500 SF):**
- Day 1: Tear-off, deck inspection, repairs
- Day 2: Underlayment, ice & water shield
- Day 3-4: Panel installation
- Day 5: Ridge/hip caps, trim, flashing
- Day 6: Final inspection, cleanup

**Total: 4-6 days** (weather permitting)

**Texas-Specific Considerations:**
- Summer heat: Start early (7 AM), breaks during peak heat
- Afternoon thunderstorms: May delay 1-2 days in spring/summer
- High-temp underlayment curing time: Factor into schedule

### Critical: Finding Certified Installers

**Why Certification Matters:**

**Stone-Coated Unique Requirements:**
- Different cutting techniques (avoid granule loss)
- Specific fastener placement (varies by brand)
- Proper panel overlap (different than shingles or standing seam)
- Specialized trim and flashing details
- Must handle panels carefully (stone coating can chip if mishandled)

**What to Verify:**

✅ **Brand-Specific Certification**
- Decra-certified (if choosing Decra)
- Gerard-certified (if choosing Gerard)  
- Metro-certified (if choosing Metro)
- Ask to see certification documents

✅ **Minimum 10-15 Stone-Coated Installations**
- Portfolio of completed stone-coated projects
- References from Texas homeowners
- Photos showing before/after

✅ **Understands Texas Requirements**
- High-temp underlayment (250°F+ rated)
- Proper attic ventilation for Texas heat
- Local building codes and permits
- Hail-prone area installation best practices

✅ **Insurance & Licensing**
- Texas licensed roofing contractor (verify with TDLR)
- $1M+ general liability insurance
- Workers' compensation coverage
- Manufacturer warranty registration (protects your warranty)

✅ **Workmanship Warranty**
- Minimum 15 years (decent)
- Better: 20-25 years
- Best: 30 years (premium installers)
- Get in writing before signing contract

**Questions to Ask Contractors:**

1. "Are you [brand]-certified for stone-coated steel installation?"
2. "How many stone-coated roofs have you installed in the last 12 months?"
3. "Can I see photos of 5+ stone-coated projects in Texas?"
4. "What's different about stone-coated vs standing seam installation?"
5. "What workmanship warranty do you provide in writing?"
6. "Do you handle permits and city inspections?"
7. "What happens if granules are damaged during installation?"
8. "How do you protect against granule loss when cutting panels?"

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

🚩 "We install all types of metal" but no stone-coated portfolio  
🚩 Can't explain installation differences  
🚩 Significantly cheaper than other quotes (cutting corners)  
🚩 No brand certification  
🚩 Pressure to decide immediately  
🚩 Vague about warranty details  
🚩 No references available  
🚩 Out-of-state company (storm chasers)

### When Stone-Coated Makes Sense

✅ **Staying in home 15+ years** (long enough to realize ROI)  
✅ **HOA restricts standing seam** but allows traditional appearance  
✅ **Traditional home style** (Spanish, Mediterranean, craftsman, traditional)  
✅ **Want lowest lifetime cost** (willing to invest upfront)  
✅ **Hail-prone area** (Texas = frequent hail, Class 4 protection valuable)  
✅ **Energy efficiency important** (15-20% cooling savings)  
✅ **Minimal maintenance desired** (virtually no upkeep)  
✅ **Premium aesthetics** (tile/shake appearance)  
✅ **Don't want to reinforce structure** (lighter than concrete tile)

### When Standard Shingles Make More Sense

✅ **Selling within 10 years** (won't recoup premium)  
✅ **Budget very tight** (limited to $20k or less)  
✅ **Don't care about energy savings**  
✅ **Don't mind re-roofing every 20-25 years**  
✅ **Standard aesthetics acceptable**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does stone-coated steel roofing really look like tile/shingles, or is it obviously metal?**

A: From ground level (8-10 feet away), stone-coated steel is virtually indistinguishable from traditional materials. The stone granule coating creates authentic texture and matte finish. Up close, you can identify interlocking panels, but 95% of visitors never notice. HOAs frequently approve it because it looks traditional, not like bare metal. The key is choosing the right profile for your home style.

**Q: Will stone granules fall off over time like asphalt shingle granules?**

A: High-quality brands (Decra, Gerard) retain 95%+ of granules for 30+ years due to superior acrylic adhesion. You'll see some granule loss in the first year (manufacturing excess), similar to new asphalt shingles. After that, granule loss is minimal. Even if granules thin after 30-40 years, the steel substrate remains fully protected. Cheaper brands may shed more granules—stick with major manufacturers.

**Q: Is stone-coated metal roofing noisy during rain and hail?**

A: Quieter than standing seam metal but slightly louder than asphalt shingles. The stone granule layer significantly dampens sound. With R-38 attic insulation (standard in Texas new construction), rain sounds are noticeable but not bothersome. Most homeowners report enjoying the gentle rain sound. Hail is more audible than on shingles but much quieter than bare metal. If absolute silence is critical, asphalt shingles are quieter.

**Q: How does stone-coated steel perform in Texas hailstorms?**

A: Excellent. Class 4 impact rating means it withstands 2" steel ball dropped from 20 feet. Real-world: survives golf ball to baseball-sized hail with minimal cosmetic denting. After severe Texas hailstorms, stone-coated roofs have less than 5% replacement rate vs 60-80% for asphalt shingles. The stone coating absorbs impact energy, protecting the steel beneath. You may see small dents but panels rarely fail or leak.

**Q: Can stone-coated metal be installed over existing shingles?**

A: Technically yes if only one layer exists and deck is sound, but we strongly recommend against it. Stone-coated panels need flat, smooth substrate for proper installation and panel seating. Removing old shingles allows deck inspection, ensures warranty compliance, and adds minimal cost ($1.50-3/SF). The small savings isn't worth potential problems. Always tear off first for stone-coated installations.

**Q: What's the best stone-coated brand for Texas?**

A: **Best overall quality:** Decra (thickest steel, best granule adhesion, longest coating warranty). **Best value:** Metro Tiles (good quality, most affordable, widest color selection). **Best shake profile:** Gerard Canyon Shake (most realistic wood appearance). **Made in USA:** Boral. For most Texas homeowners, we recommend Decra for premium projects or Metro for best value. Both perform excellently in our climate.

**Q: Will insurance rates drop with stone-coated steel?**

A: Most Texas insurers offer 20-35% discounts for Class 4 impact-rated roofing (stone-coated qualifies). Typical savings: $600-$1,500/year on average Texas home. Over 30 years, this saves $18,000-$45,000. Not all insurers offer the discount—contact your agent before installing to verify savings and get it in writing. State Farm, Allstate, USAA, and most major carriers participate.

**Q: Does stone-coated steel increase home value?**

A: Yes, typically 1-3% for mid-range homes, up to 5% for premium homes. Stone-coated roofing appeals to buyers seeking low-maintenance, long-lasting roofing. The "never re-roof again" selling point is powerful. Premium neighborhoods especially value it. Expect to recoup 65-85% of cost at resale, higher if roof is newer. Best ROI is long-term ownership (15+ years), not quick flips.

**Q: How long does stone-coated steel last in Texas heat?**

A: 40-60 years depending on brand (Decra/Gerard: 50-60 years, Metro/Boral: 40-50 years). Texas heat and UV are tough on roofing, but stone-coated handles it well. The Galvalume steel substrate resists corrosion in Texas humidity. Stone granules may thin slightly after 30-40 years (cosmetic only), but steel remains protected. Compare to asphalt shingles: 18-22 years in Texas heat.

**Q: Can I walk on stone-coated metal roofing?**

A: Yes, but carefully. Walk on flat areas between ribs, wear soft-soled shoes, avoid walking when panels are hot. Stone-coated is more dent-resistant than bare metal but can still be damaged. For maintenance, most work can be done from gutters or ladders—full roof walking rarely needed. If required, hire professional who knows proper techniques to avoid damaging stone coating or denting panels.
