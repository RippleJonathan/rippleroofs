# Austin Storm Damage Assessment Guide: How to Inspect Your Roof After Severe Weather (2025)

Austin and Travis County experience severe thunderstorms, hail, and high winds that can damage roofs throughout the metro area. After major weather events, many homeowners aren't sure whether their property sustained damage or how to document it properly. As an [Austin CertainTeed Shingle Master certified roofing contractor](/locations/austin), we've assessed storm damage on thousands of properties across the metro area.

This guide helps you understand how to safely identify storm damage, document it effectively, and know when professional inspection is necessary.

## Austin's Weather Patterns & Storm Risk

### Recent Severe Weather Events

Austin's position in Central Texas makes it susceptible to severe thunderstorms and hail:

**Spring 2024 Hailstorms**
- **Hail Size**: Golf ball to baseball (1.75"-3" diameter)
- **Areas Affected**: North Austin, Cedar Park, Round Rock, Pflugerville
- **Impact**: Widespread roof and property damage across multiple ZIP codes

**March 2023 Severe Weather**
- **Hail Size**: Tennis ball-sized (2.5"+ diameter)
- **Areas Affected**: Northwest Austin, Lakeway, Bee Cave, West Lake Hills
- **Impact**: Significant damage to roofing materials and exterior property components

**2022 Multiple Storm Events**
- **Various Severity**: Golf ball to softball-sized hail in different areas
- **Areas Affected**: South Austin, East Austin, Manor, Del Valle
- **Impact**: Sporadic but severe damage across the metro area

### Austin Areas with Higher Storm Exposure

**Neighborhoods Frequently Affected**:
- **North Austin**: Direct storm path from northwest weather systems
- **Northwest Hills**: Elevated terrain with wind and hail exposure
- **Cedar Park/Leander**: Suburb areas in "Hail Alley" corridor
- **Pflugerville**: Northeast exposure to severe weather cells
- **Round Rock**: Northern suburb with frequent hail events
- **Lakeway/Bee Cave**: Hill Country areas with severe weather
- **South Austin**: Growing areas experiencing increased storm activity
- **East Austin**: Developing neighborhoods with varied roof ages

**Important Context**: Storm damage severity varies significantly across Austin's large metro area. A storm affecting North Austin may not impact South Austin at all, making localized assessment important.

## Identifying Different Types of Storm Damage

### Hail Damage Recognition

**Shingle Damage Indicators**:
- **Granule Loss**: Dark or shiny spots where protective granules are missing
- **Impact Marks**: Visible dents, bruises, or divots in shingles
- **Fractured Shingles**: Cracks or splits in roofing material

- **Random Distribution**: Damage in irregular patterns (different from normal aging)
- **Fiberglass Matting**: Visible in severe cases where shingle integrity compromised

**Roof Component Damage**:
- Dented metal gutters and downspouts
- Damaged gutter guards or leaf screens
- Dented or cracked roof vents
- Compromised chimney caps and flashing
- Damaged skylight frames or glazing

**Property-Wide Storm Indicators**:
- Dented air conditioning condenser units
- Damaged window screens or frames
- Impact marks on siding or painted surfaces
- Fence damage or deck impact marks
- Outdoor lighting fixture damage
- Mailbox or landscape feature damage
