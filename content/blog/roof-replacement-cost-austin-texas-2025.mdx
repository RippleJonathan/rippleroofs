Now let's break down exactly what goes into these costs and how to plan your budget.

## Understanding Roof Pricing: Square Footage vs. Roofing Squares

Before getting quotes, understand how roofers measure and price roofs.

### What is a 'Roofing Square'?

A roofing square = 100 square feet of roof surface area.

**Example Calculation:**
- Home footprint: 2,000 sf
- Single-story with 5:12 pitch
- Actual roof area: ~2,400 sf (accounting for slope and overhangs)
- Roofing squares: 24 squares

**Why Roof Area ≠ Home Square Footage:**
1. **Roof Pitch**: Steeper roofs have more surface area
2. **Overhangs**: Eaves and rakes add square footage
3. **Complexity**: Valleys, dormers, and features increase area
4. **Multiple Stories**: Two-story homes may have less roof area than single-story

**Typical Roof Area Multipliers:**
- Ranch (4:12 pitch or less): Home sf × 1.1-1.2
- Two-story (6:12 pitch): Home sf × 0.6-0.7
- Steep pitch (8:12+): Home sf × 1.3-1.5

### Average Roof Sizes by Home Type in Central Texas

**Single-Story Homes:**
- 1,500 sf home = 18-20 roofing squares
- 2,000 sf home = 24-26 roofing squares
- 2,500 sf home = 30-32 roofing squares
- 3,000 sf home = 36-38 roofing squares

**Two-Story Homes:**
- 2,000 sf home = 14-16 roofing squares
- 2,500 sf home = 17-19 roofing squares
- 3,000 sf home = 20-22 roofing squares
- 4,000 sf home = 26-30 roofing squares
