Metal roofing in Round Rock is no longer just for barns and commercial buildings—it's becoming the premium choice for homeowners who want a roof that lasts 50+ years and slashes cooling costs by up to 30%.

With Round Rock's brutal summer heat (100°F+ for weeks) and frequent hailstorms, metal roofing's heat reflection and impact resistance make it one of the smartest long-term investments you can make. But it costs 2-3x more than asphalt shingles upfront, so you need to know exactly what you're getting into.

This guide covers everything Round Rock homeowners need to know about metal roofing: real costs, HOA considerations, energy savings, hail performance, and how to find qualified contractors who won't mess it up.

- R-38 attic insulation significantly dampens sound
- Solid decking quieter than open framing
- Stone-coated metal quietest

**Asphalt Shingles:**
- Very quiet
- No rain/hail sound indoors

**Winner:** Shingles (if you hate rain noise)

## Energy Savings: How Much Will You Save in Round Rock?

### The Science Behind Metal Roofing Energy Savings

Metal roofs with cool roof coatings have a **Solar Reflectance Index (SRI)** of 40-80, meaning they reflect 40-80% of solar energy back into the atmosphere instead of absorbing it into your home.

**Temperature Impact:**
- Dark asphalt shingles: Attic reaches 140-160°F on 100°F day
- Metal roof with cool coating: Attic stays 110-130°F on same day
- **20-30°F cooler attic = less heat radiating into living spaces**

### Real Round Rock Cooling Cost Savings

**Average Round Rock Home (2,500 sf):**
- Typical summer cooling bill: $250-$400/month (June-September)
- Annual cooling cost: $1,800-$2,800

**With Metal Roof:**
- 20-30% cooling cost reduction
- Monthly savings: $50-$120
- **Annual savings: $400-$800**

**30-Year Energy Savings:**
- Conservative estimate (accounting for rate increases): $15,000-$24,000
- This nearly offsets the metal roof premium vs shingles

### Additional Energy Benefits

**Radiant Barrier Underlayment:**
Add this beneath metal roofing for extra $500-$1,000 and boost savings to 30-35%. Reflects radiant heat back out through the metal roof.

**Austin Energy Rebates:**
Check if Austin Energy (serving parts of Round Rock) offers rebates for cool roof installations. Historically $300-$500 available.

**Insurance Discounts:**
Some Texas insurers offer 5-35% premium discounts for metal roofing due to fire/hail/wind resistance. Check with your provider.

**Potential total savings:** $500-$1,200/year

## Metal Roofing and Round Rock HOAs: What You Need to Know

### HOA-Restrictive Neighborhoods

Some Round Rock neighborhoods have strict architectural guidelines that limit or prohibit metal roofing. Always check BEFORE making a purchase decision.

**Neighborhoods with Known Metal Restrictions:**
- Heritage Grande (some sections require pre-approval)
- Winding Creek (traditional styles only, may limit standing seam)
- Forest Creek (check specific phase rules)

**Neighborhoods More Metal-Friendly:**
- Teravista (modern sections often allow)
- Star Ranch (Hill Country styles compatible with metal)
- Sonoma (newer, more flexible guidelines)
- Chandler Creek (check specific lots)

**How to Check Your HOA Rules:**
1. Request copy of Architectural Control Committee (ACC) guidelines
2. Look for "Roofing Materials" section
3. Check for specific prohibitions or approval processes
4. Ask about approved metal colors/styles

### Getting HOA Approval for Metal Roofing

**If metal isn't explicitly prohibited:**

1. **Submit formal ACC request** with:
   - Metal roofing product specs
   - Color samples
   - Manufacturer information
   - Photos of similar homes with metal
   - Installer credentials

2. **Emphasize benefits:**
   - Increases property values
   - Superior durability (50+ years)
   - Better hail resistance (fewer claims)
   - Energy efficiency

3. **Choose HOA-friendly options:**
   - Earth tone colors (tan, brown, charcoal, clay)
   - Stone-coated metal shingles (look like traditional)
   - Avoid bright/metallic colors

4. **Show examples:** Find other homes in neighborhood or nearby with approved metal roofs

### Alternative if Metal Is Prohibited

If your HOA absolutely won't approve metal, consider **Class 4 impact-resistant shingles** instead:
- Excellent hail protection (UL 2218 certified)
- 30-year lifespan in Texas
- Insurance discounts (often 20-35%)
- Cost: $8-$12/sf installed
- Looks traditional (HOA approved)

## Metal Roofing Performance in Round Rock Climate

### Hail Performance (Critical for Round Rock)

Round Rock is in Texas "hail alley" and gets pounded regularly. Spring 2024 saw multiple severe hailstorms in Round Rock with 1.5-2" diameter hail.

**Metal Roofing Hail Performance:**
- **Cosmetic denting** from 1"+ hail (usually doesn't affect function)
- **Rarely punctures** even from golf ball-sized hail
- **Continues to protect** home after hailstorm
- **Often doesn't require replacement** unless severe

**Asphalt Shingle Performance:**
- **Granule loss** from 1"+ hail (shortens lifespan)
- **Cracks and fractures** expose asphalt layer
- **Often requires full replacement** after major hail

**Insurance Considerations:**
- Metal may still file claim for dent repair
- Some policies cover paintless dent repair
- Metal replacement threshold much higher than shingles

**If hail resistance is your #1 priority:** Standing seam aluminum (softer than steel, won't dent as easily, but more expensive)

### Wind Resistance

Round Rock experiences strong thunderstorm winds (60-80 mph gusts common in spring/summer).

**Metal Roofing Wind Performance:**
- **140+ mph wind ratings** (standing seam)
- **Mechanically fastened** (screws won't back out like shingle nails)
- **Interlocking panels** create continuous surface
- **Best wind performance** of any residential roofing

**Asphalt Shingles:**
- 110-130 mph ratings (Class 4 shingles)
- Can lift at edges in severe winds
- Aging shingles more vulnerable

### Heat Performance

Round Rock summers are brutal: 100°F+ days from June-September, often hitting 105-110°F.

**Metal Roofing:**
- **Surface temp: 130-150°F** (with cool coating)
- **Reflects 70% of solar energy** back to atmosphere
- **Cools quickly** after sunset (doesn't retain heat)
- **Reduces attic temp** by 20-30°F

**Asphalt Shingles:**
- **Surface temp: 170-190°F** (dark shingles)
- **Absorbs 85% of solar energy** into home
- **Retains heat** for hours after sunset
- **Attic temps 140-160°F** in summer

### Lifespan Expectations in Round Rock

**Standing Seam Metal:**
- 50-70 years with proper installation
- Minimal maintenance required
- Kynar 500 finish resists fading 30+ years

**Stone-Coated Metal Shingles:**
- 40-60 years
- Stone coating may need recoating at 30 years
- Still outlasts 2+ asphalt roofs

**Exposed Fastener Metal:**
- 30-40 years
- Fasteners may need retightening at 15-20 years
- Paint may need touch-up at 25+ years

**For Comparison (Asphalt in Round Rock):**
- Class 4 impact shingles: 25-30 years
- Standard architectural: 18-22 years
- Builder-grade 3-tab: 12-15 years

## Finding Qualified Metal Roofing Contractors in Round Rock

### Why Contractor Selection Is CRITICAL for Metal

Metal roofing is NOT the same as asphalt shingle installation. It requires specialized skills, tools, and knowledge. A shingle crew cannot successfully install standing seam metal roofing—they'll create leak points, buckling, oil-canning (wavy appearance), and premature failure.

**Common mistakes by unqualified installers:**
- ❌ Over-tightening fasteners (prevents thermal expansion, causes buckling)
- ❌ Using wrong fasteners (galvanic corrosion, rust)
- ❌ Inadequate underlayment (must be high-temp rated)
- ❌ Poor flashing details (biggest leak source)
- ❌ No expansion allowance (panels lock up, create stress)
- ❌ Incorrect panel overlap (wind-driven rain penetration)

### What to Verify Before Hiring

**✅ Metal Roofing Certifications:**
- Manufacturer-specific training (CertainTeed, McElroy Metal, Metal Sales, etc.)
- Ask for certification proof (photos of certificates)

**✅ Minimum 20+ Metal Roof Installations:**
- Ask for portfolio of local metal projects
- Request references (call them!)
- Drive by completed projects if possible

**✅ Understands Thermal Expansion:**
- Metal expands/contracts with temperature
- Clips must allow movement (standing seam)
- Fasteners can't be over-tight
- Ask: "How do you handle thermal expansion?" (should have detailed answer)

**✅ Proper Fastener Knowledge:**
- Stainless steel fasteners for coastal areas
- Galvanized for inland (Round Rock)
- Fasteners must match metal type (prevent corrosion)
- Ask: "What fasteners do you use and why?"

**✅ High-Temp Underlayment:**
- Must be rated for 250°F+ (attic temps in Texas)
- Regular felt fails in Texas heat
- Should use synthetic underlayment designed for metal

**✅ Insurance and Licensing:**
- Licensed Texas roofing contractor
- $1M+ general liability insurance
- Workers' compensation insurance
- Verify through Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation

**✅ Workmanship Warranty:**
- Minimum 10 years (decent)
- Better: 15-25 years
- Best: 30 years
- Get warranty in writing before signing

### Red Flags to Avoid

🚩 **"We install all types of roofing"** but no metal-specific experience  
🚩 **Storm chasers** (out-of-state plates, pressure tactics)  
🚩 **Requires full payment upfront** (legit contractors use payment milestones)  
🚩 **No physical Round Rock address** (P.O. Box or out-of-area)  
🚩 **Won't provide references** or portfolio  
🚩 **Vague about materials/process** (lack of expertise)  
🚩 **Significantly cheaper than other quotes** (cutting corners somewhere)  
🚩 **Pushes you to make immediate decision** (high-pressure sales)

### Questions to Ask Metal Roofing Contractors

1. **How many metal roofs have you installed in the last 2 years?** (Want 15-20+)
2. **What metal roofing certifications do you hold?** (Want manufacturer training)
3. **Can I see photos of 5 recent Round Rock metal projects?** (Verify local experience)
4. **What type of underlayment do you use for metal?** (Want high-temp synthetic)
5. **How do you handle thermal expansion in standing seam?** (Want technical answer about clips/movement)
6. **What's your workmanship warranty period?** (Want 10+ years minimum)
7. **Do you handle permits and inspections?** (Should be yes)
8. **What's your payment schedule?** (Should be milestone-based, not all upfront)
9. **Will you provide a written contract before starting?** (Should be yes)
10. **How long will installation take?** (Standing seam: 4-7 days typically)

## Metal Roofing Colors for Round Rock Homes

### Best Colors for Energy Savings

**Cool Roof Colors (Highest Reflectance):**
1. **White** - SRI: 80-85 (best for energy, too bright for most)
2. **Light Gray** - SRI: 70-75 (great balance of energy + aesthetics)
3. **Beige/Tan** - SRI: 65-70 (popular in Round Rock, neutral)
4. **Light Green** - SRI: 60-65 (Hill Country style)

**Medium Reflectance:**
5. **Charcoal** - SRI: 35-45 (popular, still saves vs shingles)
6. **Bronze/Copper** - SRI: 30-40 (upscale look)
7. **Clay Red** - SRI: 25-35 (Mediterranean/Spanish style)

**Low Reflectance (Hotter):**
8. **Dark Brown** - SRI: 20-30
9. **Forest Green** - SRI: 15-25
10. **Black** - SRI: 5-15 (worst for energy, looks sleek)

**Round Rock Tip:** Even dark metal reflects more heat than dark asphalt shingles. A black metal roof still saves 10-15% on cooling vs black shingles.

### Most Popular Colors in Round Rock Neighborhoods

**Teravista/Star Ranch (Hill Country):**
- Light tan/beige
- Clay red
- Weathered zinc (gray)

**Heritage Grande/Winding Creek (Traditional):**
- Charcoal gray
- Bronze
- Clay tile red (stone-coated metal)

**Sonoma/Chandler Creek (Modern):**
- Matte black
- Galvalume (silver)
- Dark gray

**HOA-Friendly Colors:**
- Earth tones (tan, brown, clay)
- Charcoal gray
- Weathered/aged finishes
- Avoid: Bright red, blue, green, white (usually)

### Color Warranty and Fading

**Kynar 500 Finish:**
- Industry-standard coating
- 30-40 year fade warranty
- Resists UV degradation
- Chalk/fade resistance guaranteed

**SMP (Silicone Modified Polyester):**
- Budget coating option
- 20-25 year warranty
- More fading than Kynar 500
- Save $1-2/sf vs Kynar

**Recommendation for Round Rock:** Pay for Kynar 500 coating. Texas sun is brutal, and cheap paint will fade to pink/orange in 10-15 years.

## Metal Roofing Installation Process: What to Expect

### Timeline

**Standing Seam Metal Roofing:**
- Tear-off and prep: 1 day
- Underlayment and trim: 1 day
- Panel installation: 2-4 days
- Cleanup and inspection: 0.5 day
- **Total: 4-7 days for average home**

**Metal Shingles:**
- Similar to standing seam: 4-6 days

**Exposed Fastener:**
- Faster: 2-4 days

**Weather Delays:**
- Can't install in rain or high winds (safety)
- Texas heat actually helps (panels easier to work with)

### Living Through Installation

**Noise:**
- Metal cutting/drilling is LOUD
- Plan to work from home elsewhere if possible
- Pets may be stressed (kenneling recommended)

**Access:**
- Driveway blocked for dumpster (3-5 days)
- Workers on roof daily (8 AM - 5 PM typically)
- Keep garage door closed (dust protection)

**Debris:**
- Metal shavings can scatter in yard
- Good contractors magnet-sweep daily
- Keep kids/pets away from work area

**Disruption:**
- Less than you'd think
- Work is outside (no interior access needed)
- Utilities stay on
- Can cook, shower, use house normally

### Installation Steps

1. **Tear-off existing roof** (if applicable)
2. **Inspect roof deck** (repair any rot or damage)
3. **Install high-temp synthetic underlayment** (required for metal)
4. **Install drip edge and trim** (custom fabricated for metal)
5. **Install metal panels** (standing seam: clips allow expansion; exposed: screwed down)
6. **Install ridge caps and flashing** (critical for leak prevention)
7. **Final inspection** (verify all penetrations sealed, no gaps)
8. **Cleanup** (magnet sweep for metal debris, haul away old materials)
9. **City inspection** (if required by Round Rock)
10. **Final walkthrough** with homeowner

### Quality Checks During Install

**Watch For:**
- ✅ Underlayment fully covers deck (no gaps)
- ✅ Panels run straight (use chalk line)
- ✅ Consistent overlap (standing seam clips evenly spaced)
- ✅ Flashing around vents/chimneys (no gaps)
- ✅ Ridge cap properly secured
- ✅ No over-driven fasteners (exposed fastener systems)
- ✅ Daily cleanup (metal shavings removed)

**Red Flags During Install:**
- ❌ Panels bowing or buckling (over-tight fasteners)
- ❌ Gaps in underlayment
- ❌ Sloppy cutting (panels should be clean cuts)
- ❌ Workers walking carelessly on panels (denting)
- ❌ Wrong fasteners (rust will occur)

## Metal Roofing Financing in Round Rock

Metal roofing's high upfront cost is the biggest barrier for most homeowners. Financing makes it accessible.

### Financing Options

**1. Contractor Financing (Most Common)**

We partner with **Pure Finance** to offer:
- **$0 down payment**
- **0% APR for 12-18 months** (promotional, subject to credit)
- **Low monthly payments** (60-120 months available)
- **Same-day approval** (online application, 5 minutes)
- **No prepayment penalties**

**Example Payment:**
- $40,000 standing seam metal roof

**2. Home Equity Loan/HELOC**

If you have home equity:
- Lower interest rates (6-9% typically)
- Longer terms (up to 30 years)
- Tax-deductible interest (in some cases)
- Use your bank/credit union

**3. Cash-Out Refinance**

If refinancing anyway:
- Roll roof cost into mortgage
- Lowest interest rate (5-7%)
- Longest term (15-30 years)
- Only makes sense if already refinancing

**4. Personal Loan**

Last resort:
- Higher interest (10-18%)
- Unsecured (no home equity needed)
- Faster approval
- Shorter terms (3-7 years)

### Is Financing Worth It for Metal Roofing?

**YES, if you're staying in the home long-term:**

**Scenario: $40,000 metal roof financed at 8% for 10 years**
- Monthly payment: $485
- Total interest paid: $18,200
- Total cost: $58,200

**Energy savings over 10 years:** $5,000-$8,000  
**Avoided shingle replacement at year 25:** $18,000  
**Insurance savings (if discount applies):** $3,000-$8,000

**Net cost vs. shingles over 30 years:** Still saves money

**NO, if you're selling within 5-7 years:**
- Won't recoup full cost in resale value
- Better to go with Class 4 shingles instead

## Metal Roofing Maintenance in Round Rock

One of metal roofing's biggest advantages: virtually maintenance-free.

### Recommended Maintenance Schedule

**Every 3-5 Years:**
- Visual inspection from ground (look for loose panels, damage)
- Check sealant around penetrations (vents, chimneys)
- Inspect fasteners (exposed fastener systems - retighten if backing out)
- Clean gutters (prevents water backup)
- Trim overhanging branches (prevent scratching)

**Every 10-15 Years:**
- Professional inspection (detailed assessment)
- Touch up paint scratches (prevent rust on cut edges)
- Replace worn gaskets on exposed fasteners (if leaking)
- Check flashing (re-seal if needed)

**After Major Hailstorm:**
- Inspect for dents (usually cosmetic)
- Document damage for insurance (if claiming)
- Check for punctures (rare but possible)

**Total 30-Year Maintenance Cost:** $500-$1,500

**For Comparison (Asphalt Shingles):**
- Moss/algae treatment every 3-5 years: $300-500 each
- Replace damaged shingles every 5-10 years: $500-1,500
- Full replacement at 25 years: $18,000-$25,000
- **Total 30-year cost:** $20,000-$28,000+

### What You Don't Need to Do with Metal

✅ **No moss/algae treatments** (metal doesn't support growth)  
✅ **No granule loss inspections** (metal doesn't have granules)  
✅ **No shingle replacements** (panels rarely fail)  
✅ **No regular re-sealing** (standing seam has no exposed fasteners)  
✅ **No ventilation issues** (metal doesn't trap heat like shingles)

### Common Metal Roof Issues (Rare)

**1. Fasteners Backing Out (Exposed Fastener Only)**
- **Cause:** Thermal expansion/contraction
- **Fix:** Re-tighten or replace fasteners ($200-500)
- **Prevention:** Use quality fasteners with neoprene washers

**2. Scratches/Dents**
- **Cause:** Hail, falling branches, walking on roof improperly
- **Fix:** Touch-up paint ($50-150) or paintless dent repair
- **Prevention:** Trim branches, don't walk on panels carelessly

**3. Oil-Canning (Wavy Appearance)**
- **Cause:** Poor installation (panels too tight, no expansion room)
- **Fix:** Usually can't fix without reinstall
- **Prevention:** Hire qualified installer who understands thermal expansion

**4. Fading**
- **Cause:** Cheap paint (SMP vs Kynar 500)
- **Fix:** Repaint (expensive, $8,000-15,000) or live with it
- **Prevention:** Pay for Kynar 500 finish upfront

## Is Metal Roofing Worth It for Your Round Rock Home?

### Metal Roofing Makes Sense If:

✅ You plan to **own your home 15+ years**  
✅ **Energy efficiency** is a top priority (worth $500-800/year savings)  
✅ You want the **lowest lifetime cost** (willing to invest upfront)  
✅ **Low maintenance** appeals to you (virtually no upkeep)  
✅ Your home has **modern, contemporary, or Hill Country style**  
✅ **HOA allows metal** roofing (check first!)  
✅ You're comfortable with **higher upfront cost** ($25k-55k)  
✅ You value **environmental sustainability** (100% recyclable)  
✅ **Hail resistance** is important (Round Rock gets frequent hail)  
✅ You don't mind occasional **expansion/contraction noises** (popping during temp changes)

### Asphalt Shingles Make More Sense If:

✅ You're **selling within 5-10 years** (won't recoup metal premium)  
✅ **Budget is tight** ($10k-18k vs $25k-55k)  
✅ **Traditional aesthetic** is required (colonial, craftsman styles)  
✅ **HOA prohibits metal** roofing  
✅ You prefer **silent roofing** (no rain/hail sound)  
✅ **Easier contractor selection** (all roofers do shingles)  
✅ You don't prioritize energy savings  
✅ Your home has **low roof pitch** (metal requires steeper pitch for optimal performance)

### The Bottom Line for Round Rock Homeowners

**Metal roofing is one of the smartest long-term investments** you can make for a Round Rock home. The combination of 50-70 year lifespan, 20-30% energy savings, superior hail resistance, and virtually zero maintenance makes it a no-brainer for homeowners staying 15+ years.

**Yes, it costs 2-3x more upfront.** But when you factor in energy savings ($15k-24k over 30 years), avoided re-roofing costs ($18k-25k), and insurance discounts ($3k-8k), **metal roofing often costs LESS than asphalt shingles over its lifetime.**

The key is:
1. **Verify HOA allows it** (don't assume)
2. **Find a qualified metal installer** (not just a shingle crew)
3. **Choose the right metal type** (standing seam for best performance)
4. **Invest in Kynar 500 coating** (don't cheap out on paint)
5. **Plan to stay long enough** to realize the savings (15+ years)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does a metal roof last in Round Rock's climate?**

A: Standing seam metal roofs last 50-70 years in Central Texas. Stone-coated metal shingles last 40-60 years. Exposed fastener systems last 30-40 years. Even the shortest-lived metal roofing outlasts the best asphalt shingles by 10-20 years. Texas heat and UV are tough on roofs, but metal handles it better than any other material.

**Q: Will a metal roof make my house hotter in summer?**

A: No, the opposite. Metal roofing with cool roof coatings reflects 70% of solar energy, keeping your attic 20-30°F cooler than with asphalt shingles. This translates to 20-30% lower cooling costs. Even dark metal roofs reflect more heat than dark shingles. It's counterintuitive, but metal is the coolest roofing material for Texas homes.

**Q: Is metal roofing loud during rain and hail?**

A: Somewhat, but less than you'd expect. With proper attic insulation (R-38+) and solid roof decking, rain sounds are noticeable but not bothersome. Most homeowners report enjoying the gentle rain sound. Stone-coated metal shingles are quieter than standing seam. If you absolutely need silent roofing, asphalt shingles are better. But most people adapt quickly and even prefer the natural sound.

**Q: Can I install metal roofing over my existing shingles?**

A: Technically yes if you have only one layer and the deck is sound, but we don't recommend it. Removing old shingles allows proper deck inspection, ensures flat substrate for metal panels, and adds minimal cost ($1.50-3/sf). The small savings isn't worth potential problems. Always tear off first for metal roofing.

**Q: Do metal roofs attract lightning?**

A: No, this is a myth. Metal roofs don't increase lightning strike probability. Lightning strikes the highest point regardless of material. If your metal roof is struck, it's actually safer than shingles because metal is non-combustible and disperses electrical energy safely. You don't need special grounding for residential metal roofing.

**Q: Will my insurance rates go down with a metal roof?**

A: Many Texas insurers offer 5-35% discounts for metal roofing due to superior wind, fire, and hail resistance. Impact-rated metal (Class 4 equivalent) can save $500-$1,200/year. However, not all insurers offer this discount. Contact your insurance company before installing to verify potential savings. Get it in writing.

**Q: Can metal roofing handle Round Rock hailstorms?**

A: Yes, metal roofing is one of the best materials for hail resistance. It may dent from 1.5"+ diameter hail (cosmetic damage) but rarely punctures or fails. Asphalt shingles crack, lose granules, and often require full replacement after major hail. Metal roofs usually continue protecting your home even after severe hailstorms. Some insurers even cover paintless dent repair.

**Q: What's the best metal roofing color for Round Rock?**

A: Light tan/beige is most popular in Round Rock—it reflects heat well (SRI 65-70), matches Hill Country aesthetics, and is HOA-friendly. Charcoal gray is second most popular for modern homes. If energy efficiency is your top priority, choose white or light gray (SRI 75-85). Avoid dark colors like black/brown unless you prioritize aesthetics over energy savings.

**Q: How do I find a qualified metal roofing contractor in Round Rock?**

A: Look for: (1) Manufacturer certifications (CertainTeed, McElroy Metal, etc.), (2) Minimum 20+ metal roof installations, (3) Portfolio of local metal projects, (4) Verifiable references, (5) Understanding of thermal expansion, (6) Proper insurance/licensing. Avoid storm chasers, those with vague experience, or significantly cheaper quotes. Metal installation is specialized—don't hire a shingle-only crew.

**Q: Can I walk on my metal roof for maintenance?**

A: Yes, but carefully. Walk on the flat parts (pans) between ribs, not on the raised seams. Wear soft-soled shoes. Avoid walking when panels are hot (summer afternoons) or wet. For standing seam, walking rarely causes issues. For softer metals like copper or aluminum, be extra careful to avoid denting. Most maintenance can be done from gutters or with a ladder—full roof walking is rarely needed.
