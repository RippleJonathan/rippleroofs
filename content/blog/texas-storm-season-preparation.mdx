Texas storm season brings powerful winds, hail, and torrential rain that can wreak havoc on unprepared roofs. Whether you're facing tornado season in spring or hurricane threats in fall, proper preparation is your best defense.

## Why Storm Preparation Matters

Central Texas experiences some of the nation's most severe weather:

- **Average 13 hailstorms** per year in the Austin metro
- **Wind speeds** regularly exceed 70 mph during storms
- **Flash flooding** can cause rapid water accumulation
- **Tornado activity** peaks March through June

A well-maintained roof can withstand these conditions. A neglected one may fail catastrophically, causing thousands in damage.

## Pre-Storm Season Inspection Checklist

### Exterior Inspection

Start with a visual check from the ground:

- **Shingles**: Look for curling, missing, or damaged pieces
- **Flashing**: Check around chimneys, vents, and valleys
- **Gutters**: Ensure they're securely attached and clear
- **Fascia/Soffit**: Inspect for rot or damage
- **Tree branches**: Identify overhanging limbs that could fall

### Attic Inspection

Head inside to check for:

- **Daylight**: Visible light means holes or gaps
- **Water stains**: Indicates past or current leaks
- **Mold/mildew**: Suggests moisture problems
- **Insulation**: Ensure it's dry and in good condition
- **Ventilation**: Proper airflow prevents moisture buildup

## Essential Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Clean and Secure Gutters

Clogged gutters cause water backup that damages:

- Roof edges and fascia
- Foundation from overflow
- Landscape from erosion

**Action items**:
- Remove all debris (leaves, sticks, granules)
- Check for proper slope and drainage
- Secure loose hangers
- Repair or replace damaged sections
- Install gutter guards to reduce maintenance

### 2. Trim Overhanging Branches

Trees add beauty but pose storm risks:

- **Dead branches** become projectiles
- **Overhanging limbs** can crash through roofs
- **Rubbing branches** wear away protective granules

**Best practices**:
- Trim branches 6-10 feet from the roof
- Remove dead or diseased trees
- Hire certified arborists for large jobs
- Never climb on wet or storm-damaged trees

### 3. Replace Damaged or Missing Shingles

Even a few damaged shingles create vulnerabilities:

- Wind can get underneath and tear off more
- Water penetrates causing interior damage
- Small repairs prevent major replacement

**When to replace**:
- Immediately after noticing damage
- Before storm season begins
- After any severe weather event
- When granule loss is visible

### 4. Seal Flashing and Penetrations

Flashing protects vulnerable areas:

- Around chimneys and skylights
- At roof valleys
- Where walls meet the roof
- Around vents and pipes

**Maintenance steps**:
- Check for rust, cracks, or gaps
- Re-seal with appropriate caulk
- Replace damaged flashing
- Ensure proper overlap and installation

### 5. Check Attic Ventilation

Proper ventilation is critical:

- **Prevents moisture** buildup and mold
- **Extends roof life** by reducing heat stress
- **Improves efficiency** by regulating temperature
- **Reduces ice** dams in rare Texas freezes

**Ventilation types**:
- Ridge vents
- Soffit vents
- Gable vents
- Powered attic fans

Ensure intake and exhaust are balanced for optimal airflow.

## Emergency Preparation

### Create a Storm Kit

Keep these items accessible:

- **Tarps and plastic sheeting** for emergency coverage
- **Duct tape** for temporary seals
- **Flashlights and batteries** for power outages
- **Emergency contacts** including your roofer
- **Insurance policy** information and photos

### Document Your Roof's Condition

Before storm season:

1. **Take photos** of your roof from all angles
2. **Document** existing damage or wear
3. **Note** the installation date and materials
4. **Save receipts** from maintenance and repairs
5. **Update** your home inventory

This documentation proves invaluable for insurance claims.

### Know Your Insurance Coverage

Review your homeowner's policy:

- **What's covered**: Typically wind and hail damage
- **What's excluded**: Usually wear and tear
- **Your deductible**: Know what you'll pay out of pocket
- **Claim process**: Understand the steps
- **Time limits**: File within policy deadlines

## During a Storm Warning

When severe weather is imminent:

### Don't Attempt Roof Access
- **Stay off** the roof during storms
- **Avoid** going outside in high winds
- **Wait** until it's safe to assess damage

### Protect Your Interior
- **Move** valuables away from potential leak areas
- **Place** buckets or containers under active leaks
- **Turn off** electricity to affected areas if water is present
- **Document** any damage as it occurs (if safe)

### Monitor Weather Updates
- **Track** storm progress on weather apps
- **Follow** local emergency management
- **Heed** evacuation orders if issued
- **Stay** informed about changing conditions

## After the Storm

### Immediate Actions

Once it's safe:

1. **Inspect** for obvious damage from the ground
2. **Photograph** any visible issues
3. **Tarp** damaged areas if possible
4. **Contact** your insurance company
5. **Schedule** professional inspection
