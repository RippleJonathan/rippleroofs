Your roof is your home's first defense against Texas weather—intense heat, severe storms, hail, and everything in between. Yet most homeowners never inspect their roof until there's a visible problem like a leak or missing shingles.

By then, minor issues have often become major expenses.

Regular DIY roof inspections catch problems early when they're cheap and easy to fix. A $200 repair today prevents a $5,000 problem next year. But climbing on your roof without knowing what to look for—or doing it unsafely—can be dangerous and ineffective.

This comprehensive guide teaches Texas homeowners how to conduct thorough, safe roof inspections from the ground and (when safe) from the roof itself. You'll learn what to look for, when to inspect, how to document findings, and most importantly—when to call a professional instead of DIY.

## Why Regular Roof Inspections Matter

### The Financial Case

**Small Problems Become Big Expenses:**
- Missing shingle today: $50 repair
- Same spot after 6 months: $500 decking repair
- After 2 years: $5,000 structural damage + interior repairs

**Insurance Claims:**
- Storm damage has time limits (often 1 year)
- Document condition before/after storms
- Early detection = successful claims

**Resale Value:**
- Well-maintained roofs add value
- Documented maintenance history attracts buyers
- Avoid last-minute expensive repairs before selling

**Warranty Protection:**
- Most warranties require regular maintenance
- Document inspections to protect coverage
- Catch manufacturer defects within warranty period

### What Inspections Catch

**Common Issues Found Early:**
- Missing or damaged shingles
- Flashing separation around chimneys
- Clogged gutters causing water backup
- Tree branches rubbing against roof
- Early signs of algae or moss growth
- Loose or exposed nails
- Cracked rubber boots around vents
- Granule loss on shingles

**Each of these is inexpensive to fix immediately—but catastrophically expensive if ignored for years.**

## Safety First: When NOT to DIY

### Absolute Never-Climb Situations

**❌ DO NOT climb on roof if:**

1. **Steep Pitch (7/12 or steeper)**
   - Too dangerous without safety equipment
   - Hire professional instead
   - Ground inspection only

2. **Wet or Icy Conditions**
   - Extreme slip hazard
   - Wait for dry, calm weather
   - No exceptions

3. **Windy Conditions (15+ mph)**
   - Risk of being blown off
   - Difficult to maintain balance
   - Postpone inspection

4. **Health/Mobility Limitations**
   - Dizziness, balance issues
   - Joint problems, recent surgery
   - Not confident with heights
   - No shame in hiring professional

5. **Damaged or Weak Roof Structure**
   - Visible sagging
   - Suspected water damage
   - Old, deteriorated roofing
   - Professional assessment required

6. **Multi-Story Home (3+ stories)**
   - Too high for safe DIY
   - Specialized equipment needed
   - Professional only

7. **Near Power Lines**
   - Contact with lines is fatal
   - Maintain 10-foot clearance
   - Call professional if close

### Required Safety Equipment

**Minimum Safe Equipment:**

**If Climbing on Roof:**
- Non-slip rubber-soled shoes (never sandals or bare feet)
- Long pants (protect against abrasion)
- Gloves (protect hands from sharp edges)
- Roof anchor point and fall protection (steep roofs)
- Spotter on ground (someone watching)
- Fully charged cell phone

**For Ground Inspection:**
- Binoculars (8x to 10x magnification)
- Camera or smartphone
- Ladder (if inspecting gutters/eaves)
- Flashlight (for interior attic check)
- Notepad or phone for notes

### Ladder Safety Rules

**When Using Ladder:**

✓ **Extend 3 feet above roof edge**  
✓ **Set at 75° angle (1 foot out per 4 feet up)**  
✓ **On solid, level ground**  
✓ **Secured at top and bottom**  
✓ **Three points of contact always**  
✓ **Face ladder when climbing**  
✓ **Don't carry tools (use tool belt)**  

❌ **NEVER:**
- Use damaged ladder
- Lean ladder against gutter
- Overreach to either side
- Climb in windy conditions
- Use on soft or uneven ground

## The Complete Exterior Roof Inspection

### From-the-Ground Inspection (Safest Starting Point)

**What You Can See Without Climbing:**

**Use Binoculars to Check:**

1. **Overall Roof Appearance**
   - Sagging areas (indicates structural issues)
   - Uniform color and texture
   - Obvious missing or damaged shingles
   - Debris accumulation

2. **Shingle Condition**
   - Curling edges
   - Missing granules (shiny spots)
   - Cracked or broken shingles
   - Lifted or displaced shingles

3. **Roof Edges and Eaves**
   - Damaged or missing drip edge
   - Fascia rot or damage
   - Soffit ventilation clear
   - Paint condition

4. **Chimneys and Vents**
   - Flashing intact and flat
   - No gaps or separation
   - Chimney cap secure
   - Vent boots not cracked

5. **Gutters (Ground Level)**
   - Sagging sections
   - Detached from fascia
   - Rust or holes
   - Standing water

**Walk Entire Perimeter:**
- Photograph all four sides
- Note any anomalies
- Check ground for fallen shingle granules (sign of wear)
- Look for signs of leaks from interior (water stains on exterior walls)

### From-the-Roof Inspection (If Safe to Climb)

**Only proceed if:**
- Low to moderate pitch (6/12 or less)
- Dry conditions
- Calm weather
- Confident and properly equipped

**Systematic Inspection Method:**

**1. Start at Lowest Point**
- Climb up from bottom
- Work your way systematically
- Never turn back to roof while descending

**2. Check Each Section:**

**Shingle Field (Main Roof Area):**

Walk carefully (weight on balls of feet), checking:

✓ **Missing shingles or tabs**  
✓ **Cracked, curled, or buckled shingles**  
✓ **Exposed or loose nails**  
✓ **Granule loss (bald spots)**  
✓ **Algae or moss growth (black streaks or green patches)**  
✓ **Blistering or bubbling**  
✓ **Improper or inconsistent pattern**  

**3. Valleys (Critical Areas)**

Valleys concentrate water flow—inspect closely:

✓ **Valley flashing intact**  
✓ **No gaps or separations**  
✓ **Shingles properly cut and aligned**  
✓ **No debris accumulation**  
✓ **Water staining indicating leaks**  

**4. Flashing Around Penetrations**

Every chimney, vent, skylight:

✓ **Flashing lies flat against surface**  
✓ **No gaps between flashing and surface**  
✓ **Sealant not cracked or missing**  
✓ **Step flashing visible on chimneys**  
✓ **Counter-flashing intact**  

**5. Vents and Boots**

**Plumbing Vents:**
- Rubber boots: Check for cracks, splits, or hardening
- Should be flexible, not brittle
- Common failure point after 10-15 years

**Exhaust Vents:**
- Cap secure
- Screen not clogged
- Flashing sealed

**Ridge Vents:**
- Cap shingles intact
- No gaps allowing rain entry
- Properly vented inside

**6. Chimney Inspection**

✓ **Crown: No cracks or deterioration**  
✓ **Cap: Secure, screen intact**  
✓ **Mortar: No missing or crumbling joints**  
✓ **Flashing: Multiple layers properly installed**  
✓ **Counter-flashing: Secure in mortar joints**  

**7. Roof-to-Wall Intersections**

Where roof meets vertical wall:

✓ **Step flashing visible (should see metal)**  
✓ **Counter-flashing or siding overlaps step flashing**  
✓ **No gaps**  
✓ **Sealant intact if used**  

**8. Ridge and Hip Caps**

Top of roof:

✓ **Cap shingles intact**  
✓ **No missing sections**  
✓ **Properly nailed**  
✓ **No wind damage**  

**9. Gutters and Downspouts**

✓ **Securely attached**  
✓ **Proper slope (water flows)**  
✓ **No standing water**  
✓ **Clear of debris**  
✓ **Downspouts discharge away from foundation**  

## Interior Attic Inspection (Critical Component)

**Never skip the attic—many issues show here first.**

### What to Look for in Attic

**1. Water Stains and Leaks**

✓ **Dark stains on underside of roof decking**  
✓ **Water trails along rafters**  
✓ **Mold or mildew smell**  
✓ **Active dripping (during/after rain)**  
✓ **Rusty nails poking through**  

**Photo every stain—helps identify leak location on exterior.**

**2. Structural Issues**

✓ **Sagging rafters or decking**  
✓ **Cracks in decking**  
✓ **Separated or damaged trusses**  
✓ **Wood rot**  
✓ **Insufficient support**  

**Call structural engineer if concerned.**

**3. Ventilation**

✓ **Insulation not blocking soffit vents**  
✓ **Ridge vent or gable vents present**  
✓ **Airflow evident**  
✓ **No excessive heat buildup**  

**Poor ventilation = shorter roof life.**

**4. Insulation Condition**

✓ **Proper depth (R-30 to R-38 for Texas)**  
✓ **Dry (wet insulation indicates leak)**  
✓ **Evenly distributed**  
✓ **Not compressed**  

**5. Pests and Nests**

✓ **No rodent droppings**  
✓ **No wasp or hornet nests**  
✓ **No evidence of animals**  
✓ **Screens on vents intact**  

**6. Daylight Visible**

✓ **Should NOT see light through roof**  
✓ **If you do, there's a hole**  
✓ **Immediate repair needed**  

### Attic Safety

- **Wear dust mask** (insulation fibers)
- **Watch your step** (step only on joists, not between)
- **Bring flashlight** (attics are dark)
- **Avoid touching electrical** (wires, junction boxes)
- **Watch for nails** (protruding through decking)

## Seasonal Inspection Checklist

Different seasons bring different issues—tailor inspections accordingly.

### Spring Inspection (March-April)

**Focus: Storm Damage & Growth**

✓ **Check for winter storm damage**  
✓ **Look for hail damage from spring storms**  
✓ **Inspect for algae/moss starting to grow**  
✓ **Clean gutters of winter debris**  
✓ **Trim overhanging branches before summer storms**  
✓ **Check flashing before rainy season**  

**Why:** Spring storms common in Texas. Catch issues before summer heat or hurricane season.

### Summer Inspection (July-August)

**Focus: Heat Damage & Ventilation**

✓ **Check for heat-related shingle deterioration**  
✓ **Look for curling from heat exposure**  
✓ **Verify adequate ventilation (feel attic temperature)**  
✓ **Inspect for sun damage on south/west slopes**  
✓ **Check for buckled shingles from expansion**  
✓ **Look for granule loss**  

**Why:** Texas heat peaks July-August. Shingles age fast in 100°F+ temps. Ventilation critical.

### Fall Inspection (October-November)

**Focus: Prepare for Winter & Clear Debris**

✓ **Clean gutters of fallen leaves**  
✓ **Remove tree debris from roof**  
✓ **Check for damage before winter rains**  
✓ **Inspect seals and flashing**  
✓ **Trim branches before ice storms**  
✓ **Document condition before winter**  

**Why:** Prepare for winter weather. Clear debris before rain season begins.

### Winter Inspection (January)

**Focus: Water Intrusion & Ice Damage**

✓ **Check for leaks after heavy rains**  
✓ **Look for ice damage (if applicable)**  
✓ **Monitor attic for water stains**  
✓ **Check for wind damage after storms**  
✓ **Ensure gutters draining properly**  
✓ **Look for signs of poor drainage**  

**Why:** Winter brings Texas rain. Check for leaks. Identify issues before spring storm season.

## After-Storm Inspection (Critical)

**Inspect within 24-48 hours after:**
- Hail storm
- High winds (40+ mph)
- Heavy rain

- Dented vents or flashing
- Damaged landscaping or vehicles

**From Roof:**
- Random pattern of dents/divots in shingles
- Loss of granules (shiny spots)
- Cracked or punctured shingles
- Damaged ridge caps

**Document everything with photos + date stamp.**

### Wind Damage Signs

- Missing shingles or tabs
- Lifted shingle edges
- Damaged or missing ridge caps
- Debris impact damage
- Fallen tree branches

### Water Damage Signs
