Your commercial roof is one of your business's most critical assets—protecting inventory, equipment, employees, and operations from Texas's harsh weather conditions. Whether you manage an office building in Austin, a warehouse in San Antonio, or a retail center in Round Rock, understanding commercial roofing systems is essential for making informed decisions that protect your investment.

This comprehensive guide covers everything Central Texas business owners and property managers need to know about commercial roofing: system types, maintenance strategies, cost considerations, and when to repair versus replace.

## Understanding Commercial vs. Residential Roofing

Before diving into specifics, it's important to understand how commercial roofing differs from residential:

**Structural Differences:**
- **Slope**: Commercial roofs are typically flat or low-slope (less than 3:12 pitch), while residential roofs are steeply pitched
- **Materials**: Commercial roofs use membrane systems (TPO, EPDM, modified bitumen) rather than shingles
- **Size**: Commercial roofs cover larger square footage with different load requirements
- **Access**: Commercial roofs often have HVAC equipment, skylights, and regular foot traffic

**Functional Differences:**
- **Drainage**: Flat roofs require specialized drainage systems with internal drains and scuppers
- **Membrane Seaming**: Commercial roofs rely on heat-welded or adhesive seams rather than overlapping shingles
- **Maintenance**: Commercial roofs require more frequent professional inspections and preventative maintenance
- **Lifespan Expectations**: Properly maintained commercial roofs last 15-30 years depending on the system

**Regulatory Differences:**
- **Building Codes**: Commercial buildings face stricter code requirements
- **Fire Ratings**: Commercial roofs must meet Class A fire ratings in most jurisdictions
- **Wind Uplift**: Commercial buildings require engineered wind uplift ratings
- **Warranty Requirements**: Commercial warranties often mandate regular professional maintenance

## Commercial Roofing Systems for Central Texas

### 1. TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) Roofing

**Overview:**

- Document condition with photos and notes

**2. After Every Major Storm**
- Look for hail damage, punctures, or tears
- Check for displaced flashing or equipment
- Clear debris from drains and gutters
- Inspect interior for leaks or water stains

**3. Quarterly Tasks**
- Clear debris, leaves, and dirt from roof surface
- Clean drains and gutters thoroughly
- Trim overhanging tree branches
- Check and tighten HVAC equipment mounting

**4. Annual Deep Maintenance**
- Infrared or moisture scan to detect hidden leaks
- Professional cleaning of entire roof surface
- Reseal penetrations and flashings as needed
- Apply protective coatings to high-wear areas
- Update roof asset management documentation

### Cost of Preventative Maintenance

**Typical Annual Costs:**
- Small building (5,000-10,000 sf): $800-$1,500/year
- Medium building (10,000-25,000 sf): $1,500-$3,500/year
- Large building (25,000-50,000+ sf): $3,500-$8,000/year

**Return on Investment:**
Every $1 spent on preventative maintenance saves $4-$6 in future repair costs and extends roof life by 40-60%.
