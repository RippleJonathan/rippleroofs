Austin storm season is unpredictable. One minute it's sunny and 75°F, the next you're dealing with golf ball-sized hail, 70 mph winds, and 3 inches of rain in an hour.

When severe weather hits your roof, knowing what to do in the first 48 hours can save you thousands of dollars and months of stress. As [Austin's trusted storm damage roofing contractor](/locations/austin) with over 500 insurance claims handled, we've created this complete guide to help you navigate the process.

## The First 24 Hours: Emergency Response Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Within 1-2 Hours)

**1. Stay Safe**
- Wait until storm passes completely
- Don't go on roof during or immediately after storm
- Avoid standing water (downed power lines risk)
- Keep family/pets away from damaged areas

**2. Stop Further Damage**
- Move furniture/valuables away from leaks
- Place buckets under active leaks
- Turn off electricity to affected rooms
- Document water intrusion with photos

**3. Emergency Tarp Service**
- Call professional if you have active leaks
- DIY tarps often cause more damage (improper placement)
- Cost: $300-$800 (often reimbursed by insurance)
- Available 24/7 from reputable Austin contractors

**4. Initial Documentation**
- Take photos/videos of ALL damage (inside and out)
- Document neighboring homes with damage
- Photograph hail on ground (size reference with quarter/golf ball)
- Note time storm occurred
- Save weather radar screenshots

### Within 24 Hours

**5. Contact Your Insurance Company**
- Call your agent or claims hotline (most have 24/7 service)
- Get claim number immediately
- Ask about filing deadline (typically 1-2 years)
- Request adjuster inspection ASAP
- Ask about 'emergency mitigation' coverage (temporary repairs)

**6. Schedule Professional Inspection**
- Call local, certified roofing contractor (not door-knockers!)
- Get written damage assessment
- Ask for insurance claim assistance
- Avoid signing anything immediately
- Get multiple inspections if unsure

**Austin Storm Pro Tip:** After major storms, insurance adjusters are swamped. It may take 7-14 days for inspection. Document everything NOW—hail melts, evidence disappears.

## Understanding Austin Storm Damage Types

### Hail Damage (Most Common)

**What to Look For:**
- **Shingles:** Bruises (dark spots), granule loss, exposed mat, cracked seal strips
- **Vents:** Dented caps, cracked plastic
- **Gutters:** Dents, dings along edge
- **Siding:** Impact marks, dents
- **AC Unit:** Dented fins, top damage
- **Skylights:** Cracked/broken acrylic
- **Windows:** Broken screens, cracked glass

**Typical Hail Sizes in Austin:**
- Pea (1/4'): Cosmetic only
- Dime (3/4'): Minor shingle damage
- Quarter (1'): Significant damage
- Golf ball (1.75'): Severe damage, likely replacement
- Baseball (2.75'+): Complete destruction

**Insurance Coverage:**  
Hail damage is almost always covered under Texas homeowner policies. Deductibles range from $1,000-$5,000 (often 1-2% of home value).

### Wind Damage

**What to Look For:**
- Missing shingles (entire pieces gone)
- Lifted/curled shingle edges
- Torn underlayment
- Damaged flashing
- Bent/displaced gutters
- Broken tree branches on roof

**Austin Wind Reality:**  
Thunderstorms regularly produce 50-70 mph gusts. The 2022 Memorial Day storm had 80+ mph winds that ripped roofs off homes in North Austin.

**Insurance Coverage:**  
Wind damage covered, but insurers scrutinize for 'pre-existing' issues (poor maintenance, aged roof). Having annual inspection photos helps your claim.

### Water Damage (Secondary)

**What to Look For:**
- Water stains on ceilings
- Peeling paint
- Mold/mildew smell
- Sagging drywall
- Wet insulation
- Warped flooring

**Austin Reality:**  
Flash flooding and torrential rain often accompany storms. If your roof has ANY pre-existing weakness, water WILL find it.

**Insurance Coverage:**  
Interior water damage is covered IF caused by covered storm damage. Pre-existing leaks are NOT covered.

## How to File a Successful Insurance Claim in Austin

### Step 1: Understand Your Policy

**Key Coverage Terms:**
- **Dwelling Coverage:** Pays for roof repair/replacement
- **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** Depreciated value (lower payout)
- **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** Full cost to replace (better)
- **Deductible:** What you pay out-of-pocket ($1,000-$5,000+)
- **Depreciation Holdback:** Withheld until work complete

**Texas-Specific Rules:**
- Insurance must respond within 15 days
- Claims must be paid or denied within 60 days (after agreement)
- Underpayment allows you to reopen claim
- Bad faith practices are illegal (but hard to prove)

### Step 2: Meet the Adjuster

**What to Expect:**
- Adjuster inspects roof, typically 30-90 minutes
- Takes photos, measurements, damage notes
- May use drone or roof access
- Issues estimate within 7-14 days

**How to Prepare:**
- Have YOUR contractor present (levels playing field)
- Point out ALL damage (adjusters miss things)
- Show photos of neighboring damage
- Be professional but firm
- Don't accept lowball estimate immediately

**Common Adjuster Tactics:**
❌ 'That's just granule loss, not damage'  
❌ 'Your roof is too old to cover full replacement'  
❌ 'We'll only pay for partial repair'  
❌ 'You need 8-10 damaged squares for full replacement' (false)  

**Your Rights:**
✅ Second opinion from public adjuster  
✅ Challenge estimate with contractor's assessment  
✅ Request supervisor review  
✅ File complaint with Texas Department of Insurance  

### Step 3: Review the Estimate

**What Should Be Included:**
- Full tear-off and disposal
- Synthetic underlayment
- Ice & water shield (valleys, eaves)
- Drip edge replacement
- Ridge venting
- All flashing
- Pipe boots/vents
- Starter strip
- Waste/dump fees
- Permits

**Red Flags:**
❌ ACV payout only (demand RCV)  
❌ Repair estimate for 25+ year roof  
❌ Excludes code upgrades  
❌ Doesn't match contractor's scope  
❌ Suspiciously low square footage  

### Step 4: Negotiate If Needed

**When to Push Back:**
- Estimate is 30%+ less than contractor quotes
- Adjuster missed obvious damage
- They want repair instead of replacement
- Code upgrades not included

**How to Negotiate:**
- Get 2-3 contractor estimates
- Hire public adjuster (10% of settlement)
- Submit supplement request in writing
- Include photos adjuster missed
- Reference policy language
- Be persistent but professional

**Austin Pro Tip:** Most contractors will write a 'supplement' after reviewing the adjuster's estimate. This documents missed items and underpayments. Success rate: 70-80% get additional coverage.

### Step 5: Get Paid

**Payment Process:**
1. **Initial ACV Check:** Depreciated amount minus deductible
2. **Complete Repairs:** Hire contractor, get work done
3. **Final Inspection:** Insurance verifies completion
4. **RCV Check:** Recoverable depreciation paid

**Timeline:**
- Initial check: 7-30 days after agreement
- Final check: 7-14 days after completion inspection

**Payment Options:**
- Check to homeowner only
- Check to homeowner + contractor (joint)
- Check to mortgage company (if required)

## Choosing a Storm Damage Contractor in Austin

### Red Flags (Storm Chasers)

Austin gets FLOODED with out-of-state contractors after major storms. Here's how to spot scammers:

❌ **Door-to-door sales** (legitimate contractors don't need to knock)  
❌ **Pressure tactics** ('Sign now or lose this deal')  
❌ **Offers to waive deductible** (insurance fraud)  
❌ **Requires full payment upfront**  
❌ **Out-of-state company** (no local accountability)  
❌ **No physical office/showroom**  
❌ **Lowball estimate** (40-50% below market)  
❌ **Claims to work with 'all insurance companies'**  
❌ **Cash-only deals**  
❌ **No written contract/warranty**  

### Green Flags (Legitimate Contractors)

✅ **Local, established business** (5+ years in Austin)  
✅ **Physical office** you can visit  
✅ **CertainTeed Shingle Master or GAF Master Elite certified**  
✅ **100+ local reviews** (Google, BBB)  
✅ **Transparent pricing** (itemized estimates)  
✅ **Insurance expertise** (but doesn't 'guarantee' approval)  
✅ **Written warranties** (labor + materials)  
✅ **Licensed and insured** (verify!)  
✅ **References in your neighborhood**  
✅ **Professional presentation** (no pressure)  

### What 'Insurance Claim Assistance' Really Means

**Legitimate Services:**
✅ Free roof inspection and damage assessment  
✅ Meet adjuster at your home (advocate for you)  
✅ Document all damage thoroughly  
✅ Write detailed supplement requests  
✅ Explain insurance jargon and process  
✅ Provide estimates for comparison  

**Illegal Services:**
❌ Offering to waive your deductible  
❌ Inflating damage to increase payout  
❌ Filing false claims  
❌ Accepting assignment of benefits (illegal in Texas for roofing)  
❌ Demanding payment before insurance settles  

**Austin Reality:** About 30% of storm damage contractors operate in legal gray areas. Stick with certified, local companies with 100+ reviews.

## Common Austin Storm Damage Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long

**The Problem:**  
Hail damage accelerates. Compromised shingles leak faster, granule loss worsens, water damage spreads.

**The Fix:**  
Contact insurance within 48-72 hours. Even if you're not sure about damage, file a claim. You can always withdraw if not needed.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Documenting Thoroughly

**The Problem:**  
Your insurance estimate depends entirely on what the adjuster sees. If you don't show damage, they won't include it.

**The Fix:**  
Take 50-100 photos: roof from ground, close-ups of damage, interior stains, gutters, vents, siding, neighboring homes. More documentation = stronger claim.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Accepting First Offer

**The Problem:**  
Initial adjuster estimates are often 20-40% low. They're trained to minimize payouts.

**The Fix:**  
Get independent contractor estimates. Submit supplements. Challenge lowball offers. Most insurers will negotiate.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Hiring the First Contractor Who Knocks

**The Problem:**  
Storm chasers disappear after taking your money. Poor work voids warranties. Fraud charges can implicate homeowners.

**The Fix:**  
Get 3+ estimates from LOCAL, CERTIFIED contractors. Check reviews, verify insurance, visit their office.

### ❌ Mistake #5: Starting Work Before Insurance Approval

**The Problem:**  
If you complete work before adjuster inspection, they'll question whether storm caused damage. If you sign contract before claim settlement, you're liable for full cost.

**The Fix:**  
Emergency tarps are OK (and recommended). Full replacement should wait for insurance approval—unless you're paying cash.

### ❌ Mistake #6: Not Reading Your Contract

**The Problem:**  
Some contractors include clauses that make YOU responsible if insurance doesn't pay, or force you to sue your insurer.

**The Fix:**  
Read every line. Understand payment terms. Verify warranty coverage. Never sign blank contracts.

### ❌ Mistake #7: Ignoring Code Upgrades

**The Problem:**  
Austin building codes change frequently. Your 2005 roof doesn't meet 2024 standards. Some policies cover upgrades, some don't.

**The Fix:**  
Ask your contractor about code requirements (drip edge, ice & water shield, ventilation standards). Request coverage from insurance.

- Storm chasers arrive from out-of-state
- Social media fills with damage photos

**Week 1:**
- Insurance adjusters schedule inspections
