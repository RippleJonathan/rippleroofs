## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does a roof last in Round Rock?**
A: Standard shingles: 15-20 years. Impact-resistant shingles: 25-35 years. Metal: 40-50+ years. The intense Texas heat and frequent hail reduce lifespans compared to cooler climates.

**Q: Will my insurance cover hail damage?**
A: Most policies cover hail damage minus your deductible. However, some policies have cosmetic damage exclusions or limit coverage on older roofs. Review your policy and file claims within time limits.

**Q: Do I need impact-resistant shingles?**
A: In Round Rock, strongly recommended. The insurance discounts (10-35% annually) typically pay for the upgrade within 7-12 years, plus you get superior hail protection.

**Q: How long does a roof replacement take?**
A: Most Round Rock homes (2,000-2,500 sq ft) take 1-3 days depending on complexity, weather, and material choice. Metal and tile take longer than shingles.

**Q: Can I just repair instead of replace?**
A: Depends on age and damage extent. If roof is under 10 years old with isolated damage, repairs may work. If 15+ years old with widespread damage, replacement is usually more cost-effective.

**Q: Should I get multiple estimates?**
A: Yes, get 3-5 estimates. Compare not just price but materials, warranty, contractor credentials, and reviews. Cheapest is rarely best value.

**Q: What's the best time of year to replace my roof in Round Rock?**
A: Fall (October-November) and spring (March-April) offer mild weather. However, reputable contractors can work year-round. Don't wait if you have active leaks or storm damage.

**Q: How do I check if a contractor is legitimate?**
A: Verify Texas TDLR license, check BBB rating, read Google reviews, ask for local references, and visit their physical office. Avoid door-knockers after storms.
