After a major hailstorm hits San Antonio, your neighborhood gets flooded with door-knockers offering 'free inspections' and promising to 'handle your insurance claim.' Some are legitimate local contractors. Many are storm chasers who'll disappear after cashing your check—leaving you with a poorly installed roof and no warranty support.

Choosing the right roofing contractor in San Antonio isn't just about getting the best price. It's about protecting your largest investment, ensuring quality work, and having support when you need it years from now.

This guide shows you exactly how to find legitimate San Antonio roofing contractors, verify credentials, spot red flags, and avoid the scams that cost homeowners thousands.

**Bottom Line:**
- ✅ **Verify Texas contractor license** at tdlr.texas.gov
- ✅ **Check BBB rating** and recent complaints
- ✅ **Get 3-5 written estimates** (compare scope, not just price)
- ✅ **Never pay &gt;10% upfront** (red flag for scams)
- ❌ **Avoid door-knockers** after storms (90% are storm chasers)

## The Storm Chaser Problem in San Antonio

### What Are Storm Chasers?

Storm chasers are out-of-state roofing crews that follow severe weather patterns, descending on hail-damaged areas to exploit homeowners. They:

- Show up days after storms (before you've even assessed damage)
- Use high-pressure sales tactics
- Offer to 'waive your deductible' (insurance fraud)
- Collect large deposits and disappear
- Do substandard work and vanish before problems emerge
- Have no local presence for warranty support

**San Antonio is a prime target:** Our frequent hail storms (Spring 2024 had 4 major events) attract dozens of storm chaser operations every year.

### Real San Antonio Storm Chaser Stories

**Case 1: Stone Oak Homeowner Lost $18,000**
After April 2024 hail, contractor 'Texas Premier Roofing' (out-of-state plates, temporary office) collected $18,000 deposit for $35,000 job. Started work, installed underlayment poorly, then disappeared. Homeowner sued, company was shell LLC—dissolved. Had to pay second contractor $42,000 to fix damage and complete job.

**Case 2: Alamo Heights Neighborhood Scammed**
'Lone Star Storm Restoration' went door-to-door offering free inspections. Told 15 homeowners they had 'severe hail damage' (most didn't). Pressured immediate signing with 'insurance claim will be denied if you wait.' Filed fraudulent claims, insurance companies investigated entire neighborhood. Several homeowners now have difficulty getting coverage.

**Case 3: Medical Center Shoddy Work**
Contractor completed roof replacement, looked fine initially. Six months later during rain: massive leaks, improper flashing, missing underlayment in valleys. Company out of business, no callback. Cost $12,000 to repair other contractor's mistakes.

### Financial Impact

San Antonio homeowners lose **$2-5 million annually** to roofing scams. BBB reports roofing is the **#1 complaint category** after major storms.

## Red Flags: Signs of Storm Chasers & Scam Contractors

### 🚩 CRITICAL WARNING SIGNS (Avoid Immediately)

**1. Door-to-Door Solicitation After Storms**
- Legitimate local contractors have full schedules—they don't need to knock doors
- Storm chasers work neighborhood-by-neighborhood
- Often claim 'we're working on your neighbor's house' (verify this)

**2. Out-of-State License Plates**
- Check their truck plates
- Look for Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana plates (common storm chaser states)
- No local office address (P.O. box or hotel)

**3. Offers to 'Pay Your Deductible'**
- **This is insurance fraud—illegal in Texas**
- Contractor inflates claim, 'absorbs' deductible
- You can be charged with fraud
- Insurance can cancel your policy

**4. Pressure to Sign Immediately**
- 'This deal expires today'
- 'Insurance deadline tomorrow' (not true—Texas allows 1 year)
- 'I can only hold this price for 2 hours'
- Won't let you review contract with family/attorney

**5. Large Upfront Payment Required:**
- Asking &gt;10% deposit is major red flag
- 30-50% deposits = likely scam
- Some ask for full payment upfront (never do this)

**6. No Physical Business Address**
- 'Office' is P.O. box, UPS store, or vacant building
- Can't find them on Google Maps
- Temporary storefront rented for storm season

**7. Verbal-Only Estimates**
- Won't provide written contract
- Details are vague or missing
- 'We'll figure it out as we go'

**8. Can't Provide Proof of Insurance**
- Claims 'insurance is at the office'
- Shows expired certificate
- Certificate is for different company name

**9. Refuses to Pull Permits**
- 'Permits are unnecessary for this job' (false)
- 'Permits delay the project' (only 3-5 days in SA)
- Wants to start immediately without permits

**10. Uses High-Pressure Scare Tactics**
- 'Your roof will collapse'
- 'Insurance will deny if you don't file today'
- 'Severe structural damage' (when it's minor)

### 🟡 YELLOW FLAGS (Proceed with Caution)

- Business less than 2 years old
- Can't provide local references (only out-of-area)
- Reviews are all recent (5-star reviews all from same week)
- Price is 30%+ below other estimates
- Uses subcontractors exclusively (no in-house crews)
- Wants payment in cash only
- Can't explain warranty terms clearly

## How to Find Legitimate San Antonio Roofing Contractors

### Step 1: Start with Verified Sources

**Best Places to Find Legitimate Contractors:**

**Manufacturer Certification Programs:**
- **CertainTeed Shingle Master** program (certainteed.com/contractors)
- **GAF Master Elite** (gaf.com/en-us/roofing-contractors)
- **Owens Corning Preferred** (owenscorning.com/en-us/roofing/contractors)
- These require licensing, insurance, training, and track record

**Local San Antonio Resources:**
- **Better Business Bureau** (bbb.org) - Check ratings and complaint history
- **San Antonio Chamber of Commerce** - Member contractors
- **Nextdoor** - Real neighbor reviews (harder to fake than Google)
- **Angi/HomeAdvisor** - Pre-screened contractors (verify yourself too)

**Trade Associations:**
- National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) members
- Texas Roofing Contractors Association members
- These require ongoing education and ethics standards

**Personal Referrals:**
- Friends/family who had work done 2+ years ago (tested over time)
- Real estate agents (see contractor work frequently)
- Insurance agents (know which contractors work well with claims)

### Step 2: Verify Credentials (Non-Negotiable)

**Texas Contractor License:**
- Required for jobs >$1,000 in Texas
- Verify at: **tdlr.texas.gov/tools_search**
- Enter company name or license number
- Check status is 'Active' not 'Expired' or 'Revoked'

**Insurance Verification:**
1. **General Liability Insurance** ($1 million minimum)
   - Protects you if contractor damages your property
   - Call insurance company to verify coverage is current
   
2. **Workers' Compensation Insurance**
   - Protects you if worker is injured on your property
   - Without this, you can be sued by injured worker
   - Get certificate of insurance (COI) with your name listed

**Bonding:**
- Not required in Texas but shows financial stability
- Bonded contractors can compensate you if they fail to complete work

**Better Business Bureau:**
- Check BBB.org rating
- Look at complaint history (how they handle problems)
- A+ rating doesn't mean perfect—check complaint details
- Be suspicious of no reviews (very new or shell company)

### Step 3: Research Online Reputation

**Google Reviews:**
- Look for 50+ reviews minimum
- Read 3-star reviews (most honest)
- Check for owner responses (shows engagement)
- Suspicious: All 5-star reviews from same time period

**Red Flags in Reviews:**
- Generic reviews ('Great service, very professional')
- All posted within same 2-week period
- Reviewers have only 1 review total (fake accounts)
- No specific details about the work

**Legitimate Reviews Include:**
- Specific details (crew names, timeline, materials used)
- Mix of ratings (4-5 stars with occasional 3-star)
- Posted over months/years (not all at once)
- Owner responds professionally to negative reviews

**Social Media:**
- Check Facebook business page (photos of actual projects)
- Look for local job photos (San Antonio homes, not stock photos)
- Engagement with customers
- How long page has existed

### Step 4: Interview Multiple Contractors

**Get 3-5 Written Estimates:**
- Compare scope of work, not just price
- All should inspect in person (never quote over phone)
- Get everything in writing

**Questions to Ask Every Contractor:**

**About Their Business:**
1. 'How long have you been in business in San Antonio?' *(Minimum 3-5 years)*
2. 'What's your physical business address?' *(Visit if possible)*
3. 'Can I see your license and insurance certificates?' *(Verify immediately)*
4. 'Are you a certified installer for this shingle manufacturer?' *(Better warranties)*

**About the Project:**
5. 'What exactly is included in this estimate?' *(Get detailed scope)*
6. 'What brand and type of materials will you use?' *(Specify in contract)*
7. 'How long will the project take?' *(Realistic timeline)*
8. 'Who will be my main point of contact?' *(Name and phone number)*
9. 'Will you use subcontractors or in-house crews?' *(Preference for in-house)*

**About Insurance & Warranty:**
10. 'How do you handle insurance claims?' *(Experience with supplements)*
11. 'What warranties do you offer?' *(10 years labor minimum)*
12. 'What happens if there's a problem 2 years from now?' *(Still in business?)*

**About Process:**
13. 'Do you pull permits?' *(Yes, always for full replacement)*
14. 'What's your payment schedule?' *(Never &gt;10% upfront)*
15. 'Can you provide 5 recent local references?' *(Call them!)*

### Step 5: Check References Thoroughly

**What to Ask References:**

1. 'When was your roof completed?' *(Recent = better)*
2. 'Were there any problems during or after installation?' *(How handled)*
3. 'Did they finish on time and on budget?' *(Project management)*
4. 'How was communication?' *(Responsive?)*
5. 'Would you hire them again?' *(Ultimate question)*
6. 'Any advice for me?' *(Open-ended insights)*

**Red Flags:**
- Contractor won't provide references
- References are all from 5+ years ago
- Can't reach any references
- References are vague or scripted

**Extra Step:** Drive by reference addresses to see roof quality (with permission).

## Understanding Written Estimates & Contracts

### What a Legitimate Estimate Must Include

**Company Information:**
- Full legal business name
- Physical address (not P.O. box)
- License number
- Phone number and email

**Scope of Work Detail:**
- 'Complete tear-off of existing roof system'
- 'Install [brand] [type] shingles in [color]'
- 'Replace damaged decking as needed ($X per sheet)'
- 'Install synthetic underlayment'
- 'Install ice & water shield in valleys and eaves'
- 'Install new drip edge and flashing'
- 'Install ridge vent for proper ventilation'
- 'Clean up and haul away all debris'

**Materials Specifications:**
- Shingle brand and model (CertainTeed Landmark, GAF Timberline HDZ, etc.)
- Underlayment type (synthetic vs. felt)
- Fastener specifications
- Ventilation components
- Flashing materials

**Project Details:**
- Start date (or estimated start window)
- Completion timeline (number of days)
- Work hours (8am-6pm typical)
- Weather delay policy

**Pricing Breakdown:**
- Material costs (itemized)
- Labor costs
- Permit fees
- Disposal fees
- Total cost
- Payment schedule

**Warranties:**
- Manufacturer warranty (shingles: 25-50 years)
- Workmanship warranty (labor: 10+ years minimum)
- Warranty transferability (if you sell home)

**Permits & Inspections:**
- 'Contractor will obtain all necessary permits'
- 'Final inspection by City of San Antonio included'

**Insurance & Liability:**
- 'Contractor maintains general liability insurance'
- 'Contractor maintains workers' comp insurance'
- Certificate of insurance attached

### Payment Schedule Red Flags

**SAFE Payment Structure:**
- **Deposit:** 0-10% to secure materials
- **Progress payments:** 30% at completion of tear-off, 30% at shingle installation, 30% at final inspection
- **Final payment:** 10% after you inspect and approve

**DANGEROUS Payment Structure:**
- 50% upfront (too high)
- Full payment before completion
- Cash only
- Payment to individual (not company)

**Texas Law:** Contractors cannot require &gt;10% deposit before starting work on residential projects.

### Contract Must-Haves

**Before You Sign:**
- ✅ Everything is in writing (no verbal additions)
- ✅ All blanks are filled in (no 'TBD' items)
- ✅ You understand every line
- ✅ Pricing is clear and itemized
- ✅ Timeline is realistic
- ✅ Warranty terms are explicit
- ✅ Payment schedule is reasonable
- ✅ You have 24+ hours to review (don't sign immediately)

**Never Sign If:**
- ❌ Pressured to sign immediately
- ❌ Contract has blanks or unclear terms
- ❌ Price seems too good to be true (&gt;30% below others)
- ❌ Contractor won't let you keep a copy
- ❌ Something feels wrong (trust your gut)

## Special Considerations for Insurance Claims

### Working with Contractors on Insurance Claims

**Legitimate Contractor Practices:**
- ✅ Free inspection to document damage
- ✅ Provides detailed report with photos
- ✅ Explains insurance claim process
- ✅ Helps with supplement requests (additional damage found)
- ✅ Works directly with adjuster if you authorize
- ✅ Waits for insurance approval before starting

**Storm Chaser Insurance Scams:**
- ❌ Offers to 'waive your deductible'
- ❌ Inflates claim with fake damage
- ❌ Tells you to sign insurance check over to them
- ❌ Starts work before insurance approval
- ❌ Files claim without your knowledge
- ❌ Claims they're 'insurance preferred contractor' (verify with your insurer)

### The Deductible Waiver Scam

**How It Works:**
1. Contractor: 'We'll waive your $2,000 deductible!'
2. Reality: They inflate the claim by $2,000-$3,000
3. Insurance pays inflated amount
4. Contractor does $2,000 less work than claimed
5. You think you got a deal (you didn't—you got fraud)

**Why This Is Illegal:**
- Insurance fraud in Texas (criminal offense)
- Your policy can be cancelled
- You can be prosecuted
- Contractor disappears—you have no recourse

**What You Should Pay:**
Your deductible is **your responsibility**. Budget for it. Legitimate contractors will never offer to waive it.

### Texas-Specific Insurance Rules

**1-Year Filing Deadline:**
Must file claim within 1 year of storm date. Document all storm events.

**Replacement Cost Value (RCV) vs. Actual Cash Value (ACV):**
- Insurance pays depreciated value upfront (ACV)
- Pays full replacement cost after work complete (RCV)
- Total received minus deductible = your benefit

**Matching Shingles:**
Texas law requires insurance to pay for matching replacement if discontinued shingles. If they can't match, they may owe full roof replacement.

## San Antonio Contractor Pricing: What's Reasonable?

### Typical Pricing Ranges

**Standard Architectural Shingles:**
- **Small home** (1,200-1,500 sq ft): $10,500-$15,000
- **Average home** (2,000 sq ft): $13,000-$18,000
- **Large home** (3,000 sq ft): $20,000-$28,000

**Impact-Resistant Shingles:**
- Add $3,000-$5,000 to above prices
- Worth it: 20-35% insurance discount

**Metal Roofing:**
- Typically 2-3x cost of shingles
- Average home: $26,000-$45,000

### Price Red Flags

**Too Low (30%+ Below Average):**
- Using inferior materials
- Cutting corners (no underlayment, poor flashing)
- Planning to upsell/change order
- Won't be around for warranty

**Too High (30%+ Above Average):**
- May be legitimate (premium service, best materials)
- OR taking advantage of insurance claim
- Get second opinion before proceeding

**Right Approach:** Get 3-5 estimates, throw out highest and lowest, choose from middle based on reputation and scope.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I find the best roofing contractor in San Antonio?**
A: Start with manufacturer certification programs (CertainTeed Shingle Master, GAF Master Elite), check BBB ratings, verify Texas contractor license at tdlr.texas.gov, get 3-5 written estimates, and call references. Avoid door-knockers after storms—90% are storm chasers.

**Q: What should I look for in a San Antonio roofer?**
A: Verify active Texas contractor license, general liability + workers' comp insurance, 5+ years local business history, physical San Antonio office address, manufacturer certifications, 10+ year workmanship warranty, and strong BBB rating with minimal complaints.

**Q: How can I spot storm chaser roofers?**
A: Red flags include door-to-door solicitation after storms, out-of-state license plates, offers to 'waive your deductible,' pressure to sign immediately, large upfront deposits (&gt;10%), no physical local office, can't provide proof of insurance, and won't pull permits.

**Q: Is it illegal for roofers to waive my insurance deductible?**
A: Yes, it's insurance fraud in Texas. Contractors who 'waive deductibles' inflate insurance claims illegally. You can be charged with fraud, your policy can be cancelled, and the contractor typically disappears. Always pay your deductible.

**Q: How much should I pay a contractor upfront?**
A: Never more than 10% deposit. Texas law protects consumers from excessive upfront payments on residential projects. Safe payment structure: 0-10% deposit, progress payments during work, final 10% after your approval. Avoid contractors demanding 30-50% upfront.

**Q: How do I verify a roofing contractor's license in Texas?**
A: Visit tdlr.texas.gov/tools_search and enter the company name or license number. Verify status shows 'Active' not 'Expired' or 'Revoked.' All contractors performing work over $1,000 must be licensed in Texas.

**Q: What insurance should my roofer have?**
A: General liability insurance ($1 million minimum) and workers' compensation insurance. Request certificates of insurance (COI) and call the insurance company to verify coverage is current. Without workers' comp, you can be sued if a worker is injured on your property.

**Q: How many estimates should I get for a roof replacement?**
A: Get 3-5 written estimates from licensed contractors. Compare scope of work, not just price. Throw out the highest and lowest bids. Choose from the middle based on reputation, credentials, and detailed contract terms.

**Q: Should I hire the cheapest roofing contractor?**
A: No. If a bid is 30%+ below others, they're either cutting corners (inferior materials, poor installation), planning to upsell later, or won't be around for warranty support. Choose based on value—quality materials, proper credentials, and strong reputation.

**Q: What warranties should a San Antonio roofer provide?**
A: Manufacturer warranty (shingles: 25-50 years depending on type) and workmanship warranty (labor: minimum 10 years, ideally 15-25 years). Verify warranty is transferable if you sell your home. Get warranty terms in writing before signing contract.
