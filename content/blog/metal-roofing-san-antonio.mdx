## Metal Roofing Energy Savings in San Antonio Heat

### How Metal Roofing Saves Energy

**Reflectivity:**
Metal roofs reflect 65-75% of solar radiation vs. shingles absorbing 80-90%.

**Emissivity:**
Metal releases absorbed heat quickly after sunset. Shingles retain heat into the evening.

**Ventilation:**
Metal roofs pair well with proper attic ventilation for air circulation underneath.

**Cool Roof Coatings:**
Special coatings can boost reflectivity to 85%+, further reducing heat absorption.

### Real San Antonio Energy Savings

**Typical San Antonio Home (2,000 sq ft, good insulation):**
- **Summer cooling cost** (May-Sep): $1,000-$1,200/year
- **Metal roof savings**: 15-25% reduction
- **Annual savings**: $150-$300

**Poorly Insulated Home:**
- **Summer cooling cost**: $1,500-$2,000/year
- **Metal roof savings**: 20-30% reduction (greater impact when insulation poor)
- **Annual savings**: $300-$600

**Factors That Increase Savings:**
- Light-colored metal (white, tan, light gray)
- Proper attic ventilation
- Adequate attic insulation (R-30+ recommended)
- West-facing roof exposure (afternoon sun)

**Factors That Decrease Savings:**
- Heavy tree shade (already blocking sun)
- Dark metal colors (absorb more heat)
- Poor attic insulation (heat enters house regardless)

### Return on Investment (Energy Only)

**Conservative Estimate:**
- Metal premium: +$18,000
- Annual energy savings: $200
- **Payback period**: 90 years (energy alone doesn't justify)

**BUT ADDING:**
- Lifespan savings: +$20,000-$30,000 (avoid 1-2 replacements)
- Insurance discounts: +$150/year × 50 years = $7,500
- **Total ROI becomes positive in 15-20 years**

## Metal Roofing Performance in San Antonio Climate

### Heat Resistance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Extreme Summer Heat (95-105°F for weeks):**
- Metal reflects heat instead of absorbing
- Cools down quickly after sunset
- Reduces attic temperatures 15-30°F vs. shingles

- Poor installation = leaks, noise, premature failure

**What to Verify:**
- ✅ Metal roofing certification (manufacturer-specific)
- ✅ 20+ metal roof installations (get references)
- ✅ Photos of local metal projects
- ✅ Understands thermal expansion requirements
- ✅ Uses proper fasteners (stainless steel for coastal, galvanized inland)

### Installation Process

**Day 1-2: Tear-Off & Prep**
- Remove existing shingles
- Inspect and repair decking
- Install high-temperature underlayment
- Install drip edge and flashing

**Day 3-5: Panel Installation**
- Measure and cut panels (custom fabricated)
- Install panels from eave to ridge
- Interlock seams (standing seam) or fasten panels
- Install ridge cap and trim

**Day 6: Flashing & Detail Work**
- Custom fabricate chimney/vent flashing
- Install closures and sealants

**Q: Does metal roofing really save money on cooling in San Antonio?**
A: Yes, 15-25% reduction in summer cooling costs typical. Metal reflects 65-75% of solar heat vs. shingles absorbing heat. Average savings: $150-$300/year depending on home insulation, roof color, and AC usage. Light colors save more than dark.

**Q: How long does a metal roof last in San Antonio?**
A: 40-70 years depending on type. Standing seam metal: 50-70 years. Metal shingles: 40-50 years. San Antonio's heat doesn't degrade metal like it does shingles. You'll outlive 2-3 asphalt shingle roofs with one metal roof.

**Q: Is metal roofing loud during rain and hail?**
A: Can be louder than shingles, but proper insulation and underlayment significantly reduce noise. Stone-coated metal is quieter than bare metal. Most homeowners report noise is not an issue with proper installation. Inside attic space, metal is noticeably louder; inside living areas, difference is minimal.

**Q: Does metal roofing increase home value in San Antonio?**
A: Metal roofing can increase resale value 1-6% ($3,000-$18,000 for median San Antonio home). Appeals to energy-conscious buyers and those tired of frequent roof replacements. ROI varies—best return if neighborhood already has metal roofs. May not recoup full premium if selling quickly.

**Q: What color metal roof is best for San Antonio heat?**
A: Light gray, white, or tan for maximum energy efficiency (reflects 65-80% of sunlight). These save 20-30% on cooling costs. Dark colors (charcoal, bronze) save only 5-10% but may be required for aesthetics or HOA rules. Light colors stay cooler and perform better.

**Q: Can you install solar panels on a metal roof?**
A: Yes, standing seam metal roofing is ideal for solar panels. Clamps attach to raised seams without penetrating roof (no leak risk). Metal roofs last 50+ years—perfect match for 25-30 year solar panel lifespan. Easier and cheaper to install solar on metal than shingles.

**Q: Does insurance cost less with a metal roof in San Antonio?**
A: Most San Antonio insurance companies offer 10-30% discounts for metal roofing due to superior hail, wind, and fire resistance. Discounts vary by insurer. Average savings: $150-$400/year. Call your insurance agent for specific discount rates before deciding.

**Q: What are the disadvantages of metal roofing?**
A: Higher upfront cost (2-3x shingles), can be louder during rain/hail, limited qualified installers in some areas, denting from large hail (cosmetic, not functional), potential for oil-canning (wavy appearance) if installed incorrectly, and some HOAs restrict metal roofing.

**Q: Can I install metal roofing over existing shingles?**
A: Technically possible but not recommended. Better to tear off for proper inspection of decking, ensure adequate ventilation, and avoid adding excessive weight. Most manufacturers void warranties if installed over shingles. Cost savings ($1,500-$2,500) not worth long-term risks.
