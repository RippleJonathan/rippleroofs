# Georgetown Storm Damage Assessment: Identifying Roof Damage After Hail & Wind (2025)

Georgetown, Texas sits in Williamson County's "Hail Alley," experiencing frequent severe weather that can damage roofs, gutters, and property. After major storms, many homeowners struggle to determine whether they have damage and how to document it properly. As [Georgetown's CertainTeed Shingle Master certified roofing contractor](/locations/georgetown), we've assessed storm damage on hundreds of properties throughout the area.

This comprehensive guide shows you how to safely identify potential storm damage, document it effectively, and understand when professional inspection is essential.

## Georgetown's Storm Exposure

### Recent Severe Weather Events

Georgetown's location northwest of Austin makes it particularly vulnerable to severe storms:

**Spring 2024 Severe Weather**
- **Hail Size**: Golf ball to baseball (1.75"-2.75" diameter)

**2022 Multiple Storm Events**

### Georgetown Neighborhoods Frequently Affected

**Areas with Higher Storm Activity**:
