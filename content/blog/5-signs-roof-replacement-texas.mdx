Your roof is your home's first line of defense against the harsh Central Texas elements. But how do you know when it's time to move beyond repairs and invest in a [complete replacement](/services/roof-replacement)? Here are five critical signs every homeowner should watch for.

## 1. Age of Your Roof

The most straightforward indicator is the age of your roofing system. Most asphalt shingle roofs last **20-25 years**, depending on:

- Quality of materials used
- Installation workmanship
- Climate conditions
- Maintenance history

If your roof is approaching or has exceeded this timeframe, it's time for a professional inspection—even if you don't see obvious problems. Waiting too long can lead to:

- Interior water damage
- Structural issues
- Higher energy bills
- Decreased home value

## 2. Widespread Shingle Damage

A few damaged shingles can be repaired, but widespread issues signal the need for replacement. Look for:

- **Curling or cupping** at the edges
- **Missing granules** (you'll see bald spots or granules in gutters)
- **Cracked or broken shingles** across multiple areas
- **Missing shingles** after storms

In Central Texas, our intense sun and occasional severe weather can accelerate shingle deterioration. If more than 30% of your roof shows these signs, replacement is typically more cost-effective than extensive repairs.

## 3. Sagging or Structural Issues

A sagging roof is a serious problem that demands immediate attention. This can indicate:

- Water damage to the roof decking
- Compromised structural support
- Accumulated moisture in the attic
- Weight stress from multiple roof layers

**Never ignore a sagging roof.** This is a safety hazard that requires professional evaluation immediately. Even minor sagging can indicate significant hidden damage.

## 4. Daylight Visible Through the Roof

If you can see daylight through your roof boards when you're in the attic, you have a serious problem. This means:

- Your roof's weather barrier is compromised
- Water can penetrate during rain
- Pests can enter your home
- Energy efficiency is severely impacted

Check your attic on a sunny day. Any light streaming through indicates holes or gaps that need addressing. While small issues might be repairable, multiple light spots usually mean comprehensive replacement is needed.

## 5. Interior Water Damage or Leaks

Water stains on your ceiling or walls are clear evidence of roof problems. Pay attention to:

- **Discolored patches** on ceilings
- **Peeling paint** near the roofline
- **Mold or mildew** growth in the attic
- **Active dripping** during or after rain

Even if leaks seem minor, they can cause extensive damage over time, including:

- Rotted framing and decking
- Destroyed insulation
- Mold problems affecting health
- Electrical hazards

One or two isolated leaks might be repairable, but multiple leak points or extensive water damage typically require full replacement.

## The Texas Factor: Storm Damage Considerations

Central Texas experiences unique weather challenges:

- **Hail storms** can destroy shingles in minutes
- **High winds** can lift and tear roofing materials
- **Intense sun** accelerates aging and deterioration
- **Temperature fluctuations** cause expansion and contraction

After significant weather events, always schedule an inspection—even if damage isn't immediately visible. Insurance claims for storm damage have time limits, so don't delay.
