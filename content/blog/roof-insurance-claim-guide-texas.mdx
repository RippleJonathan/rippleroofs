## Understanding Your Texas Homeowners Insurance Coverage

Before diving into the claims process, it's critical to understand what your policy covers—and what it doesn't.

### Standard Coverage Components

**Dwelling Coverage (Coverage A):**
- Covers the structure of your home, including the roof
- Typically replaces or repairs using 'like kind and quality' materials
- May be actual cash value (ACV) or replacement cost value (RCV)
- Deductible applies to roof damage claims

**Other Structures (Coverage B):**
- Covers detached structures (garage, shed, fence)
- Usually 10% of dwelling coverage amount
- Subject to same perils as main dwelling

**Personal Property (Coverage C):**
- Covers belongings damaged by roof leaks
- Important if roof leak damages interior items
- Subject to separate deductible in some policies

**Additional Living Expenses (Coverage D):**
- Pays for temporary housing if home is uninhabitable
- Covers hotel, food, and other living expenses
- Typically 20-30% of dwelling coverage amount

### Types of Coverage: ACV vs. RCV

**Actual Cash Value (ACV):**
- Pays replacement cost minus depreciation
- Common on older roofs (15+ years)
- Results in lower payout
- You receive depreciated value upfront

**Example:** $15,000 roof repair, 10-year-old roof (50% depreciated)
- Insurance pays: $7,500 initially
- You pay: $7,500 + deductible

**Replacement Cost Value (RCV):**
- Pays full replacement cost without depreciation
- More expensive premium but better protection
- Paid in two stages: ACV first, depreciation after completion
- You receive full value eventually

**Example:** $15,000 roof repair
- Insurance pays: $7,500 initially (ACV)
- After completion: $7,500 recoverable depreciation
- You pay: Only your deductible

### Common Deductibles in Texas

**Percentage Deductibles (Most Common):**
- 1% of dwelling coverage: Good for low-risk areas
- 2% of dwelling coverage: Standard for Central Texas
- 3-5% of dwelling coverage: Common in hail-prone areas

**Example Calculation:**
- Home insured for $300,000
- 2% deductible = $6,000 out-of-pocket
- $20,000 claim pays: $14,000 from insurance

**Flat-Dollar Deductibles:**
- $1,000-$2,500 fixed amount
- Becoming less common for wind/hail coverage
- Easier to budget and plan for

**Wind/Hail Deductibles:**
- Often separate, higher deductible
- 1-5% of dwelling coverage
- Only applies to wind and hail damage
- Other perils use standard deductible

### What's Typically Covered

✅ **Hail Damage:**
- Dented or cracked shingles
- Granule loss

## The First 24 Hours: Critical Steps After Storm Damage

The actions you take immediately after discovering damage can make or break your claim.

### Step 1: Document the Storm Event (15 minutes)

**Create a Storm File:**
- Date and time of storm
- Type of storm (hail, wind, tornado)
- Weather service reports from weather.gov
- Local news coverage screenshots
- Hail size reports from neighbors or weather apps

**Why This Matters:** Insurance companies often dispute that damage occurred during a specific storm. Documentation proves the event happened.

### Step 2: Prevent Further Damage (ASAP)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Place buckets under active leaks
2. Move valuables away from wet areas
3. Take photos BEFORE moving anything
4. Cover broken windows or holes with tarps
5. Document all mitigation efforts with photos

**Emergency Tarping:**
- Call a reputable roofing company for emergency tarping
- Cost typically: $500-$2,500 depending on size
- Usually covered by insurance
- GET PHOTOS before and after tarping

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** You have a duty to 'mitigate further damage.' Failing to tarp can result in claim denial for interior water damage.

### Step 3: Conduct Initial Inspection (30 minutes)

**Exterior Inspection (From Ground Level):**
- Walk around home and photograph all sides of roof
- Look for missing/damaged shingles
- Note damaged gutters, vents, or flashing
- Check for dented garage doors, siding, windows
- Document any debris or tree damage

**Interior Inspection:**
- Check attic for water stains or leaks
- Inspect ceilings for stains, sagging, or wet spots
- Look at walls for water marks
- Document all interior damage with photos
- Note any damaged personal property

⚠️ **SAFETY WARNING:** Never climb on your roof yourself. Leave professional inspection to licensed contractors and insurance adjusters.

### Step 4: Take Comprehensive Photos (1 hour)

**Photo Documentation Checklist:**

**Exterior:**
- [ ] All four sides of home
- [ ] Close-ups of damaged shingles (from ground)
- [ ] Damaged gutters, downspouts
- [ ] Damaged vents, flashing, ridge caps
- [ ] Dented AC unit, garage door
- [ ] Comparison photos of undamaged sections
- [ ] Overall context shots showing whole house
- [ ] Property address visible in some photos

**Interior:**
- [ ] Water stains on ceiling
- [ ] Sagging or bubbling ceiling
- [ ] Water stains on walls
- [ ] Wet insulation in attic
- [ ] Damaged personal property
- [ ] Mold growth (if present)

**Details:**
- [ ] Date/time stamp enabled on camera
- [ ] Multiple angles of same damage
- [ ] Wide shots showing context
- [ ] Close-ups showing detail
- [ ] Reference objects for scale (coin, ruler)

📱 **Pro Tip:** Use your smartphone's location services to embed GPS coordinates in photos. This proves photos were taken at your property.

### Step 5: Contact Your Insurance Company (Day 1)

**Before You Call:**
- Locate your policy number
- Have storm date and details ready
- Prepare list of known damage
- Be ready to describe immediate needs

**During the Call:**
- Report the claim as soon as possible
- Be factual and accurate
- Don't speculate about damage extent
- Ask about emergency repair coverage
- Request immediate temporary repairs if needed
- Get claim number and adjuster name
- Ask about timeline for inspection

**Record Everything:**
- Claim number
- Date and time of call
- Representative name and ID
- Adjuster name and contact info
- Scheduled inspection date
- Next steps outlined

## Step-by-Step: The Claims Process

### Phase 1: Initial Claim Filing (Days 1-3)

**What Happens:**
1. Insurance assigns claim number
2. Claims adjuster is appointed
3. Inspection is scheduled (usually 3-7 days out)
4. You may receive initial claim forms

**Your Actions:**
- Complete all paperwork promptly
- Don't sign anything until you understand it
- Keep copies of everything
- Continue documenting any new damage discovered

### Phase 2: Adjuster Inspection (Days 3-10)

**Before the Inspection:**
- Don't have roofing company repairs done yet
- You CAN have a roofing contractor present (recommended!)
- Compile all documentation in organized folder
- List all damage you've found
- Prepare questions for adjuster

**During the Inspection:**
- Be present and take notes
- Ask adjuster to point out damage they see
- Point out damage you've documented
- Ask if damage warrants full replacement or repairs
- Request copy of adjuster's notes and measurements
- Get business card and direct contact information

**After the Inspection:**
- Adjuster typically provides estimate in 3-5 business days
- Estimate shows scope of work and costs
- May include ACV (actual cash value) check
- Review carefully before accepting

### Phase 3: Get Independent Assessment (Days 7-14)

**Why You Need This:**
Insurance adjusters often miss damage or underestimate scope. Having a professional roofing contractor inspect provides:
- Second opinion on damage extent
- Detailed estimate to compare with insurance
- Identification of overlooked damage
- Expert testimony if you need to appeal

**Choose Your Contractor Carefully:**
✅ Licensed and insured in Texas
✅ Experience with insurance claims
✅ Will provide detailed written estimate
✅ Won't charge for initial inspection
✅ Doesn't require you to sign contract before seeing insurance estimate

❌ Avoid 'storm chasers' who:
- Go door-to-door immediately after storms
- Offer to 'handle everything' with insurance
- Want you to sign over insurance proceeds
- Promise to waive your deductible (illegal!)
- Have out-of-state license plates and no local office

### Phase 4: Review Insurance Estimate (Days 10-15)

**Compare Estimates Carefully:**

**Common Discrepancies:**
1. **Square Footage Measurement:**
   - Insurance: 2,200 sf
   - Actual: 2,600 sf
   - Impact: 18% underpayment

2. **Scope of Work:**
   - Insurance: Replace damaged shingles only
   - Reality: Full replacement needed due to age/matching
   
3. **Material Quality:**
   - Insurance: Basic 3-tab shingles
   - Existing: Architectural shingles
   - You're owed 'like kind and quality'

4. **Additional Items:**
   - Missing: Underlayment replacement
   - Missing: Drip edge
   - Missing: Ventilation upgrades required by code
   - Missing: Permit fees

**Line Item Review:**
- Check quantities (squares of shingles, linear feet of ridge)
- Verify pricing is reasonable for Central Texas
- Confirm all damaged components are included
- Look for 'non-covered' line items (may be debatable)

### Phase 5: Negotiate or Appeal (Days 15-30)

**If Estimates Don't Match:**

**Option 1: Supplemental Claim**
- Most common approach
- Submit contractor's estimate to adjuster
- Request re-inspection
- Adjuster writes 'supplement' for additional items
- Usually resolved in 1-2 weeks

**How to Submit:**
1. Email contractor estimate to adjuster
2. Include photos of items insurance missed
3. Write brief cover letter explaining differences
4. Request another inspection or phone discussion
5. Follow up in 48 hours if no response

**Option 2: Formal Appeal**
- Required if adjuster won't budge
- Submit written appeal to insurance company
- Include documentation supporting your position
- May involve manager or senior adjuster review
- Takes 15-30 days typically

**Option 3: Hire Public Adjuster**
- Independent professional who represents YOU
- Typically takes 10-15% of settlement
- Worth considering for large or complex claims
- Must be licensed in Texas

**Option 4: Appraisal Clause**
- Most policies include 'appraisal' provision
- Each side hires appraiser
- Appraisers hire neutral umpire
- Binding decision on damage value
- You pay for your appraiser, insurance pays theirs
- Usually $1,000-$3,000 total cost

**Option 5: Department of Insurance Complaint**
- File complaint with Texas Department of Insurance
- www.tdi.texas.gov
- TDI investigates and mediates
- Can result in fines against insurance company
- Free service to Texas residents

### Phase 6: Receive Payment (Days 20-40)

**Understanding Payment Structure:**

**Initial Payment (ACV):**
- Actual Cash Value minus deductible
- Covers depreciated value
- You receive this before work starts
- Used to pay contractor deposit

**Example:**
- Total claim: $20,000
- Depreciation: $5,000
- Your deductible: $2,000
- Initial check: $13,000 ($20,000 - $5,000 - $2,000)

**Final Payment (RCV):**
- Recoverable depreciation
- Paid after work is completed
- Requires proof of completion
- Must submit final invoice

**Continuing Example:**
- After completion, submit invoice for $20,000
- Insurance pays: $5,000 (recoverable depreciation)
- Your total payment: $18,000
- Your out-of-pocket: $2,000 (deductible)

**Mortgage Holder Considerations:**
If you have a mortgage, insurance checks typically:
- Made payable to you AND mortgage company
- Require mortgage company endorsement
- May be held in escrow by lender
- Released in stages as work progresses

**Process:**
1. Deposit check with your bank
2. Bank sends to mortgage company for endorsement
3. Mortgage company inspects work (sometimes)
4. Funds released to you (may be in draws)
5. You pay contractor

### Phase 7: Complete Repairs (Days 30-60)

**Selecting Your Contractor:**
- Get 3 written estimates
- Verify license and insurance
- Check references and reviews
- Ensure they'll handle insurance communication
- Confirm warranty terms

**During Repairs:**
- Stay in communication with contractor
- Ask about surprises or additional damage found
- Take progress photos
- Report new issues to insurance immediately

**Final Inspection:**
- City building inspector approval (if permit required)
- Your walk-through with contractor
- Insurance final inspection (for RCV release)
- Document completion with photos

### Phase 8: Submit for Recoverable Depreciation (Days 60-70)

**Required Documentation:**
- Final invoice from contractor (itemized)
- Proof of payment (cancelled checks, credit card receipts)
- Completion certificate from contractor
- Photos of completed work
- Building permit sign-off (if applicable)
- Lien waiver from contractor

**Submit to Insurance:**
- Send complete package to claims adjuster
- Follow up in one week if no response
- Typical processing time: 2-3 weeks
- Direct deposit or check mailed

## Common Claim Denials and How to Avoid Them

### Denial Reason #1: 'Pre-Existing Damage'

**Insurance Says:** 'This damage existed before the storm.'

**How to Fight It:**
- Show previous inspection reports (none found)
- Provide photos from before storm
- Get expert opinion letter from contractor
- Demonstrate damage pattern consistent with storm type
- Request specific evidence of pre-existing condition

**Prevention:**

- Point to damage patterns (hail dimples, wind tears)
- Reference policy language on covered perils

**Prevention:**
- Maintain roof properly (keep records)
- Report damage promptly after storms
- Don't wait years to file claim

### Denial Reason #3: 'Not Enough Damage for Replacement'

**Insurance Says:** 'Only 30% damaged, repair is adequate.'

- Get contractor statement on maintenance adequacy
- Distinguish maintenance from storm damage
- Show photos of well-maintained roof

**Prevention:**
- Keep ALL maintenance receipts

**Insurance Says:** 'You didn't report damage within required timeframe.'

**How to Fight It:**
- Show you didn't discover damage immediately
- Prove damage wasn't visible or accessible
- Document when damage became apparent
- Request exception based on circumstances
- File complaint with Texas DOI if unreasonable

**Prevention:**
- Report damage within days of storm
- Don't wait to see if it gets worse

## Working with Roofing Contractors: Best Practices

### Negotiation Strategies

**Don't Accept First Offer:**
- Initial estimates often incomplete

**Costs:**
- Public adjuster: 10-15% of settlement

## Central Texas Storm Patterns & Timing

### Peak Hail Season (March-June)

**Highest Risk Months:**
- April and May see most severe hail
- Central Texas 'Hail Alley' includes Round Rock, Georgetown, Austin
- Golf ball to baseball-sized hail common
- Multiple severe storms per season typical

**Post-Storm Actions:**

- Many contractors booked out weeks
- Material shortages possible after major event

### Hurricane Season (June-November)

**Wind and Water Risks:**
- Hurricane remnants bring heavy rain and wind
- Flash flooding common
- Tree damage from saturated soil and wind

**Insurance Considerations:**
- Wind coverage through homeowners policy
- Flood requires separate policy (FEMA)
- Document water source (roof vs. ground)

### Winter Freezes (December-February)

**Ice Damage:**

- Document date of freeze event
- Report as soon as damage discovered

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do I have to file a roof insurance claim in Texas?

Most Texas homeowners policies require you to report damage 'promptly' or 'as soon as possible'—typically interpreted as within a reasonable time after discovery. However:

- Report within **days** of storm for best results
- Most policies allow claims up to 1 year from loss date
- Hidden damage discovered later can still be claimed
- Statute of limitations is 2 years for lawsuit

**Best Practice:** Report within 1 week of storm damage, even if you're not sure of extent.

### Will filing a claim raise my insurance rates?

**Reality Check:**
- **One claim** usually doesn't increase rates significantly
- **Multiple claims** (2-3 in 3-5 years) can impact rates or renewability
- **Catastrophic storm** (affecting whole area) usually doesn't count against you
- **Your claim history** stays with CLUE report for 7 years

**What Affects Rates More:**
- Claims frequency more than amount
- At-fault claims (maintenance) worse than storm claims
- Multiple small claims worse than one large claim

### Can my insurance company drop me for filing a claim?

**Texas Law Protection:**
- Insurance can't cancel policy mid-term except for non-payment or fraud
- Insurance CAN non-renew at policy end after claims
- Must provide 30-60 days notice of non-renewal
- State farm mutual companies have better protections

**After How Many Claims:**
- Typically safe with 1 claim
- 2 claims in 3 years = higher risk of non-renewal
- 3+ claims = very likely non-renewal

**If Non-Renewed:**
- Shop for new carrier before policy expires
- Texas FAIR Plan available as last resort
- May pay higher rates for 3-5 years
- Still better than not maintaining coverage

### What if my contractor's estimate is higher than insurance?

This is very common and usually resolved through:

**Step 1: Supplemental Claim**
- Contractor submits detailed estimate to adjuster
- Insurance re-inspects or reviews photos
- Adjuster writes 'supplement' for approved additional items
- Usually adds 10-30% to original estimate

**Step 2: Negotiation**
- Discuss specific line item differences
- Provide documentation (photos, material specs)
- Get contractor to explain why items are necessary
- Insurance may approve some but not all

**Step 3: Your Options:**
- Accept insurance amount and downgrade materials/scope
- Pay difference out-of-pocket
- Find contractor who will work for insurance amount
- Pursue appraisal or formal dispute process

**Typical Outcome:** Insurance increases estimate 15-40% after contractor involvement.

### Should I use the contractor recommended by my insurance company?

**Pros of Insurance Preferred Contractor:**
- Pre-negotiated pricing with insurance
- Streamlined claims process
- Insurance may offer additional guarantees
- Known relationship speeds resolution

**Cons:**
- Works for insurance company regularly (bias?)
- May not fight for full coverage
- Limited choice
- Not always best quality or price

**Our Recommendation:**
- Get estimate from insurance contractor
- Also get 2 independent estimates
- Compare scope, quality, warranty, reputation
- Choose based on YOUR needs, not insurance preference
- Good independent contractors work well with all insurance companies

### Can insurance force me to use used or aftermarket materials?

**Texas Law:**
- Insurance must provide 'like kind and quality'
- Can't force inferior materials
- Must match existing materials reasonably

**Reality:**
- Insurance prefers generic/economy brands
- You're entitled to equivalent quality
- If exact match unavailable, insurance pays for upgrade
- Document original material brand and quality

**Your Rights:**
- Refuse used materials for structural components
- Request OEM (original equipment manufacturer) if specified in policy
- Get written explanation if insurance insists on downgrade

### What happens if damage is less than my deductible?

**If Damage < Deductible:**
- Insurance won't pay anything
- You still want to file claim to document damage
- Creates record if additional damage found later
- Protects you if damage worsens

**Example:**
- Repair cost: $4,500
- Your deductible: $5,000
- Insurance pays: $0
- You pay: $4,500

**Should You File Anyway?**
- **Yes, if:** Close to deductible amount (within $1,000)
- **Yes, if:** Additional damage may be discovered
- **No, if:** Far below deductible and clearly minor
- **No, if:** You've had multiple recent claims

### How do I prove hail damage to my roof?

**Adjuster Looks For:**

**On Shingles:**
- Circular dents with exposed asphalt
- Bruised appearance with displaced granules
- Consistent pattern across roof
- More damage on slopes facing storm direction

**On Metal Components:**
- Dents in vents, flashing, drip edge
- Dimples in AC unit, gutters
- Satellite dish damage
- Window screen damage

**Documentation You Provide:**
- Weather report showing hail in your area
- Photos of damage from ground level
- Neighbor reports of hail
- Professional contractor inspection
- Hail size estimates from weather service

**Test Marks vs. Damage:**
- Insurance may claim 'test marks' from walking
- Real hail damage: Random pattern, round impacts
- Test marks: Scuff marks, linear patterns, corner impacts
- Contractor should avoid walking on damaged areas

### What if I already had my roof repaired before filing a claim?

**Problems:**
- Insurance can't verify damage extent
- May deny claim for lack of proof
- Can't determine cause of damage
- Contractor may have covered up evidence

**Solutions:**
- Provide before photos if you have them
- Get contractor's detailed written report
- Submit contractor's invoice and scope
- May require sworn statement from contractor
- Consider appraisal if insurance denies

**Best Practice:**
- **Always** file claim BEFORE repairs
- Only emergency repairs should happen pre-claim
- Document emergency repairs thoroughly
- Insurance should approve major repairs first
