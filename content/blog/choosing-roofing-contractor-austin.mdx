Choosing a roofing contractor might be the most important decision you make as a homeowner—get it wrong and you're facing $15,000-$30,000 in repairs, voided warranties, insurance headaches, or worse.

Austin's roofing industry has legitimate, skilled professionals who've served the community for decades. It also has unlicensed storm chasers, fly-by-night operators, and contractors who will take your deposit and disappear.

After major storms, Austin homeowners lose millions to roofing scams every year. The difference between a quality roof that lasts 30+ years and a nightmare that leaks within 5 years often comes down to contractor selection—not material choice. If you need immediate help after storm damage, check our guide on [emergency roof repair](/blog/emergency-roof-repair-storm).

This comprehensive guide shows you exactly how to find, vet, and hire a trustworthy roofing contractor in Austin, avoid common scams, understand contracts, and ensure you get the quality work you're paying for.

## The Austin Roofing Industry Landscape

Understanding the local market helps you navigate contractor selection:

### Types of Roofing Contractors in Austin

**1. Established Local Companies (BEST CHOICE)**
- In business 5-20+ years locally
- Physical office location in Central Texas
- Licensed, insured, bonded
- Strong local references and reviews
- CertainTeed, GAF, or Owens Corning certifications
- 10-year+ workmanship warranties
- Invested in community reputation

**2. Regional Companies (GOOD OPTION)**
- Serve multiple Texas cities
- Professional operations and systems
- Licensed and properly insured
- Good contractor oversight
- May not have deep local ties
- Generally reliable but less personalized

**3. Storm Chasers (AVOID)**
- Appear after major storms
- Out-of-state license plates
- Temporary local presence (rent space short-term)
- High-pressure sales tactics
- Take deposit and disappear or do shoddy work
- Gone when warranty issues arise

**4. Unlicensed Handymen (AVOID)**
- "Guy with a truck" operations
- No proper insurance or licensing
- Cash-only, no contracts
- No warranty or recourse
- You're liable if they're injured on your property
- Can void manufacturer warranties

**5. Door-to-Door Solicitors (EXTREME CAUTION)**
- Knock on doors offering "free inspections"
- Use high-pressure tactics ("sign today for this price")
- Often storm chasers in disguise
- Legitimate companies rarely solicit door-to-door
- Many Austin neighborhoods prohibit solicitation

### Austin-Specific Challenges

**Post-Storm Surges:**
After hail storms, Austin sees influx of out-of-state contractors:
- Limited Texas Department of Licensing oversight
- Difficult to pursue legal action after they leave state
- Quality issues emerge after they've left town
- Warranty claims go unanswered

**High Demand Market:**
Austin's growth creates challenges:
- Reputable contractors often booked 2-6 weeks out
- Some homeowners choose questionable contractors due to urgency
- "Too busy" contractors may rush jobs or overextend

**HOA Requirements:**
Many Austin neighborhoods have HOA restrictions:
- Color/material approvals required
- Specific installation standards
- Contractor must understand local HOA processes
- Choose contractor experienced with Austin HOAs

## Red Flags: Warning Signs to Avoid

These signs indicate you're dealing with an unprofessional or fraudulent contractor:

### 🚩 RED FLAG #1: Door-to-Door Solicitation

**The Scenario:**
Someone knocks on your door claiming:
- "We're working on your neighbor's roof and noticed yours has damage"
- "We have leftover materials from another job in your area"
- "Sign today and we can give you a special price"

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Legitimate, established companies don't need to solicit
- High-pressure tactics indicate desperation for work
- Often storm chasers who will leave after getting deposits

**Exception:** After major storms, some legitimate companies canvas neighborhoods, but they should still provide proper credentials and never pressure immediate decisions.

**What to Do:**
- Thank them and close the door
- Google the company (check reviews, location, license)
- If interested, call their office directly (not the door-knocker)
- Get multiple quotes before deciding

### 🚩 RED FLAG #2: No Physical Local Address

**The Scenario:**
- P.O. Box only (no physical office)
- Out-of-state address
- "We're based in [distant city] but work all over"
- Virtual office or shared workspace

**Why It's a Problem:**
- Easy to disappear after taking payment
- No local accountability
- Difficult to pursue legally
- No local reputation at stake

**What to Verify:**
- Google Maps their address (is it real office?)
- Drive by to confirm physical presence
- Check Better Business Bureau for location
- Verify Texas Contractor License shows local address

### 🚩 RED FLAG #3: Requests Large Upfront Payment

**The Scenario:**
- Asks for 50% or more upfront
- Wants full payment before starting
- Requests cash or unusual payment methods
- Says they need money to "buy materials"

**Why It's a Problem:**
- **Texas law** prohibits contractors from requesting more than 10% or $1,000 (whichever is less) upfront
- Large upfront payments indicate cash flow problems or scam
- You have no leverage if work isn't completed properly

**Legal Standard:**
Texas Occupations Code Section 305.009:
- Max upfront: Lesser of $1,000 or 10% of total
- Payment schedule tied to work completion
- Violations are prosecutable

**Red Flags in Payment Requests:**
- Cash only (no paper trail)
- Personal checks to individual (not company)
- Wire transfers or Venmo (hard to recover)
- "Pay my guys directly" (indicates cash flow issues)

**Proper Payment Structure:**
- 10% or less to schedule and order materials
- 40-50% at project completion
- Final 40-50% after inspection and cleanup
- Credit card or company check preferred (protection)

### 🚩 RED FLAG #4: No License or "License Pending"

**The Scenario:**
- Can't produce Texas contractor license number
- Says "license is pending" or "I'm working under someone's license"
- Provides license from another state only
- Claims license isn't needed for roofing

**Reality Check:**
- All residential roofing contractors in Texas MUST be licensed
- Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) license required
- $1,000-$10,000 fines for unlicensed work
- You're liable if unlicensed contractor injures themselves

**How to Verify License:**
1. Ask for Texas TDLR license number
2. Visit: [www.tdlr.texas.gov](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov)
3. Search license database
4. Verify:
   - Active status
   - Correct company name
   - No disciplinary actions
   - Insurance coverage current

### 🚩 RED FLAG #5: Unverifiable Insurance

**The Scenario:**
- Won't provide Certificate of Insurance (COI)
- Says "insurance expired but renewal is coming"
- Provides COI that's expired or incomplete
- Only has liability (no workers comp)

**What You MUST Verify:**
1. **General Liability Insurance:** $1-2 million minimum
   - Covers property damage during work
   - Protects you from contractor accidents

2. **Workers Compensation Insurance:**
   - Covers contractor's crew if injured
   - Without this, YOU are liable for injuries
   - Texas law allows companies to opt out, but you shouldn't hire them

**How to Verify Insurance:**
- Request Certificate of Insurance directly from contractor
- Call insurance company listed on COI to verify it's active
- Check effective dates (must cover your project dates)
- Never start work without current insurance verification

**Your Risk Without Proper Insurance:**
- Liable for injuries to workers on your property ($100k-$1M+)
- Property damage not covered if contractor causes issues
- No recourse if contractor damages neighbor's property

### 🚩 RED FLAG #6: Offers to "Waive Your Deductible"

**The Scenario:**
"Sign with us and we'll waive your insurance deductible"
"We'll inflate the estimate to cover your deductible"
"We'll pay your deductible out of our profit"

**Why This Is Illegal:**
- **Insurance fraud** (felony in Texas)
- Contractor inflates estimate to cover your deductible
- Insurance company gets defrauded
- You can be prosecuted for participating
- Insurance can cancel your policy

**How the Scam Works:**
1. Contractor says roof costs $15,000 (real cost: $12,000)
2. Your $3,000 deductible is "waived"
3. Insurance pays $15,000
4. Contractor pockets $3,000 extra
5. You participated in insurance fraud

**Consequences:**
- Criminal charges (fraud)
- Insurance policy cancellation
- Difficulty getting future insurance
- Contractor cuts corners to make up inflated bid

**Legal Alternative:**
Some contractors offer financing or payment plans for deductibles—this is legal as long as insurance estimate is honest.

### 🚩 RED FLAG #7: No Written Contract or Vague Contract

**The Scenario:**
- Handshake agreements or verbal promises
- Contract missing critical details
- "Standard agreement" with blank sections
- Reluctance to put specifics in writing

**What Must Be in Writing:**
1. **Scope of work** (specific materials, brand, model numbers)
2. **Total cost** (itemized if possible)
3. **Payment schedule** tied to milestones
4. **Timeline** with start and completion dates
5. **Warranty details** (workmanship and materials)
6. **Permit information** (who obtains, cost)
7. **Cleanup and disposal** responsibilities
8. **Change order process** (how changes are priced/approved)
9. **Cancellation terms** for both parties

**Red Flags in Contracts:**
- "Material and labor costs subject to change"
- No material specifications (brand, grade, color)
- No warranty terms or "verbal warranty"
- No contractor license number on contract
- No company address or phone

### 🚩 RED FLAG #8: Extremely Low Bid

**The Scenario:**
You get 3 quotes:
- Company A: $18,000
- Company B: $17,500
- Company C: $11,000 ⚠️

**Why Ultra-Low Bids Are Dangerous:**
- Using inferior or wrong materials
- Skipping critical steps (underlayment, flashing, ventilation)
- Unlicensed/uninsured (no overhead costs)
- Planning to cut corners or abandon job
- Bait-and-switch (lowball, then "discover" issues)

**Reality Check:**
Roofing materials and labor have standard costs:
- Quality materials: $3-5 per sq ft
- Professional labor: $2.50-4 per sq ft
- Total installed: $6-10 per sq ft for standard roofs

**A 2,000 sq ft roof under $12,000 is suspicious.**

**How to Evaluate Low Bids:**
- Ask for detailed material specifications
- Verify same scope as other bids
- Check if permits/disposal are included
- Confirm insurance and licensing
- Ask for detailed breakdown

**Better Strategy:**
Choose middle bid from reputable company, not lowest bid from unknown contractor.

## Essential Verification Steps

Before hiring any contractor, complete these verification steps:

### 1. License Verification (Required)

**Texas TDLR Database Check:**
1. Visit [tdlr.texas.gov](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov)
2. Click "License Holder Search"
3. Enter company name or license number
4. Verify:
   - Status: "Current/Active"
   - Name matches business cards/contract
   - No disciplinary actions
   - Insurance coverage noted

**What You're Looking For:**
- Active status (not expired or suspended)
- Company name matches marketing materials
- Clean disciplinary history
- Texas-based address

**Red Flags:**
- Can't find license (unlicensed)
- Expired or suspended status
- Multiple complaints or actions
- License in different name than advertised

### 2. Insurance Verification (Required)

**Request Certificate of Insurance (COI):**
- Ask contractor to provide COI
- Must include:
  - General Liability ($1-2M minimum)
  - Workers Compensation (or verified opt-out)
  - Effective dates covering your project
  - Insurance company contact info

**Call Insurance Company:**
- Use number on COI (not contractor-provided number)
- Verify policy is active and current
- Confirm coverage amounts
- Verify contractor name matches

**Never Skip This Step:**
You're personally liable for injuries without proper insurance.

### 3. References and Reviews

**Online Reviews:**
- **Google Reviews:** Most reliable (verified buyers)
- **Better Business Bureau:** Shows complaint history
- **Yelp:** Additional consumer feedback
- **Facebook:** Community recommendations

**What to Look For:**
- 4+ stars average with 50+ reviews
- Recent reviews (past 12 months)
- Photos of completed work
- Responses to negative reviews (shows professionalism)

**Red Flags:**
- No online presence at all
- All 5-star reviews from same month (fake)
- Many complaints about disappearing/shoddy work
- "A" BBB rating but 2 stars on Google (inconsistent)

**Request Direct References:**
- Ask for 3-5 recent Central Texas customers
- Call references (don't just email)
- Ask specific questions:
  - "Did they stay on schedule?"
  - "Were there surprise costs?"
  - "How was cleanup?"
  - "Any issues after completion?"
  - "Would you hire them again?"

**Visit Previous Jobs (If Possible):**
- Drive by recently completed projects
- See quality firsthand
- Ask contractor for addresses of recent work

### 4. Manufacturer Certifications

**Why Certifications Matter:**
- Training on proper installation techniques
- Access to better warranties (50-year vs. 25-year)
- Accountability to manufacturer
- Demonstrates commitment to quality

**Key Certifications:**

**CertainTeed Shingle Master:**
- Highest CertainTeed certification
- Enhanced warranties available
- Regular training requirements
- Quality inspections by manufacturer

**GAF Master Elite:**
- Top 3% of GAF contractors

- Trained crews
- Quality guarantees

**How to Verify:**
- Ask contractor which certifications they hold
- Visit manufacturer website to verify
- Look for certification logos on marketing materials
- Confirm certification is current (not expired)

### 5. Better Business Bureau Check

**What BBB Shows:**
- Years in business
- Complaint history
- Response to complaints
- BBB rating (A+ to F)
- Accreditation status

**How to Interpret:**
- A/A+ rating: Good sign
- B rating: Acceptable if few complaints
- C or lower: Concerning
- Not rated: May be too new or not accredited

**Warning:** BBB rating alone isn't definitive—check multiple sources.

## The Bid Comparison Process

You've received 3-5 quotes. How do you compare them fairly?

### Create a Comparison Spreadsheet

| Item | Company A | Company B | Company C |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Total Price** | $17,500 | $18,200 | $11,000 |
| **Years in Business** | 15 years | 8 years | 2 years |
| **License Verified** | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | ✗ Can't verify |
| **Insurance Verified** | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | ✗ No COI |
| **Shingle Brand/Model** | GAF HDZ | Owens Corning Duration | "Architectural shingles" |
| **Underlayment** | Synthetic | Synthetic | "Standard" |
| **Warranty - Material** | 50 years | 50 years | 30 years |
| **Warranty - Workmanship** | 10 years | 5 years | 1 year |
| **Permits Included** | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | "Not needed" |
| **Disposal Included** | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | Extra $500 |
| **Timeline** | 2-3 days | 2 days | "1 day" |
| **Google Reviews** | 4.8 (120) | 4.6 (85) | No reviews |
| **BBB Rating** | A+ | A | Not rated |
| **Certification** | CertainTeed Master | GAF Master Elite | None |

**Analysis:**
- Company C is clearly unacceptable (unlicensed, uninsured, vague scope, lowball)
- Company A costs $700 less than B but has longer workmanship warranty and more experience
- Company B has GAF Master Elite certification (valuable if you want GAF Golden Pledge warranty)

**Decision:** Company A or B depending on warranty preference. Never Company C.

### Look Beyond Price

**Don't choose based on price alone. Consider:**

1. **Reputation** (reviews, references, years in business)
2. **Proper licensing and insurance**
3. **Scope of work** (apples-to-apples materials)
4. **Warranty terms** (10-year workmanship > 1-year)
5. **Communication** (responsive, professional)
6. **Certifications** (manufacturer backing)

**A $2,000 higher bid from a reputable company is worth it vs. savings from questionable contractor.**

5. **Confirm completion:** Inspect repair before signing off

**Most reputable contractors fix minor issues promptly at no charge.**

### Major Issues (Persistent leaks, widespread problems)

1. **Stop further damage:** Place buckets, tarps to protect interior
2. **Document thoroughly:** Photos, videos, dates, extent of damage
3. **Written notice:** Send certified letter describing issues and requesting repair
4. **Set deadline:** "Please address by [date]"
5. **Get second opinion:** Have another contractor inspect if contractor won't respond
6. **Review contract:** Check warranty terms and dispute resolution clauses

### If Contractor Won't Fix Issues

2. **BBB complaint:** Can damage contractor's rating
3. **Contact insurance company:** Your homeowner's policy may cover contractor defects
4. **Legal action:** Small claims court (under $20,000) or hire attorney
5. **Manufacturer warranty:** If manufacturer-certified contractor, contact manufacturer

### Your Legal Rights in Texas

**Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act:**
Protects homeowners from:
- False or misleading statements
- Failure to disclose material information
- Unconscionable actions

- Contractors must correct defects
- Written notice required before lawsuit
- Reasonable opportunity to inspect and repair

**Consult attorney if major issues persist.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many quotes should I get?**
A: 3-5 from reputable companies. Too many quotes wastes time without providing additional value.

**Q: Should I choose the lowest bid?**
A: Almost never. Middle-range bid from reputable company is safest. Lowest bid often indicates cut corners or scam.

**Q: Can I negotiate roofing bids?**
A: Sometimes. Contractors may negotiate on payment terms, financing, or upgrades. Rarely on total price (margins are already thin).

**Q: How long should a roof replacement take?**
A: 1-3 days for standard residential roof (2,000-3,000 sq ft). Larger or complex roofs take longer.

**Q: Do I need to be home during installation?**
A: Not required, but recommended for final walkthrough. Crew doesn't need access to interior typically.

**Q: What happens if it rains during my roof replacement?**
A: Reputable contractors watch weather and work around forecasts. They'll tarp exposed areas if surprise rain occurs. Most underlayment is waterproof.

**Q: Should I hire a public adjuster for insurance claims?**
A: Maybe. They take 10-15% of settlement but can maximize claim. Roofing contractor can assist for free (but can't negotiate settlement—that's public adjuster territory).

**Q: Can I pay contractor with insurance check?**
A: Yes, but wait until work is complete. Endorse check together with contractor after final walkthrough.

**Q: Do I need a building permit for roof replacement?**
A: Sometimes. Depends on local jurisdiction. Round Rock, Austin, and most Austin suburbs require permits. Contractor should handle this.

**Q: How do I verify contractor's work with manufacturer warranty?**
A: Contractor should register warranty with manufacturer. You'll receive confirmation. If contractor is certified (Master Elite, etc.), warranty registration is often automatic.
