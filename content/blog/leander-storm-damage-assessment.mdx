# Leander Storm Damage Assessment: How to Inspect Your Roof After Hail & Wind (2025)

Leander sits in the heart of "Hail Alley," experiencing severe weather events that can damage roofs, gutters, and siding. After a major storm, many homeowners aren't sure how to assess whether their property sustained damage. As [Leander's CertainTeed Shingle Master certified roofing contractor](/locations/leander), we've inspected over 650 properties after storm events and understand what to look for.

This guide helps you identify potential storm damage, document it properly, and understand when to contact your insurance company.

## Understanding Leander's Storm Patterns

### Recent Major Weather Events

Leander's location northwest of Austin creates a natural storm corridor. Here are significant weather events that affected local properties:

**March 2023 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Golf ball to tennis ball (1.75"-2.5" diameter)
- **Areas Affected**: Crystal Falls, Benbrook Ranch, Mason Hills, widespread across Leander
- **Impact**: Significant roof, gutter, and siding damage reported

**May 2022 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Baseball-sized (2.75"+ diameter)
- **Areas Affected**: Eastern Leander (Chandler Creek, Forest Creek, Paloma Lake)
- **Impact**: Severe damage to roofing materials and exterior property components

**April 2021 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Softball-sized (4"+ in some areas)
- **Areas Affected**: Northwestern Leander (Teravista, Walsh Ranch, Heritage Center)
- **Impact**: Extensive damage requiring professional assessment

### Leander Neighborhoods with Higher Exposure

**Areas That Experience More Severe Weather**:
- **Teravista**: Open terrain with less natural windbreak

- **Walsh Ranch**: Large master-planned community affected by multiple events
- **Heritage Center**: Established neighborhood where aging roofs may be more vulnerable
- **Brushy Creek**: Historic area with varied roof ages and materials

**Important Note**: Storm damage isn't always immediately visible. Professional inspection is often necessary to identify compromised roofing materials.
