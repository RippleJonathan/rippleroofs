A: Yes, strongly recommended. Georgetown experiences major hail every 2-3 years. Insurance discounts typically pay for upgrade within 7-12 years.

**Q: What are historic district requirements?**
A: Must get Certificate of Appropriateness from Historic Landmark Commission. Materials and colors must be appropriate to building period. Process adds 2-4 weeks.

**Q: Does Sun City HOA have special requirements?**
A: Yes, pre-approval required for materials and colors. Generally reasonable but must follow process. Allow 2-3 weeks for approval.

**Q: What's best for rural Georgetown properties?**
A: Metal roofing excellent choice - fire resistant, long-lasting, low maintenance. Standing seam or 5V crimp popular. Budget for access fees.

**Q: Should I repair or replace my 20-year-old roof?**
A: Likely replace. Roofs 20+ years old typically cost more to repair repeatedly than to replace, especially in Georgetown's harsh climate.

**Q: Can I get financing if I'm retired?**
A: Yes, several options: insurance claims (if storm damaged), contractor financing, home equity (if available), senior programs, or payment plans.

**Q: How often should I have my roof inspected in Georgetown?**
A: Every 2-3 years for roofs under 10 years old. Annually for roofs 15+ years old. Always after hail events.
