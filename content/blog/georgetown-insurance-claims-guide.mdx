# Georgetown Roof Insurance Claims Guide: How to Get Full Coverage After Hail Damage (2025)

Georgetown sits in Williamson County's severe hail corridor—where devastating storms hammer roofs 2-4 times annually. After golf ball-sized hail damages your Sun City, Wolf Ranch, or historic downtown Georgetown home, insurance companies send adjusters who often miss damage, deny legitimate claims, or offer settlements that don't cover full replacement. As [Georgetown's CertainTeed Shingle Master certified roofing contractor](/locations/georgetown), we've helped over 800 Georgetown homeowners successfully navigate insurance claims and recover millions in rightful coverage.

This comprehensive guide reveals exactly how to file, document, and win your Georgetown roof insurance claim in 2025.

## Understanding Georgetown's Hail Problem

### Recent Major Storm Events

Georgetown's location between Temple and Austin creates a perfect storm corridor. Here are the hailstorms that devastated Georgetown roofs:

**March 2023 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Golf ball to baseball (1.75"-3" diameter)
- **Areas Hit**: All of Georgetown, especially Sun City, Westview, Berry Creek
- **Insurance Claims Filed**: 3,500+ in Georgetown alone
- **Average Claim Payout**: $15,000-$22,000
- **Outcome**: Most roofs needed full replacement

**April 2021 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Tennis ball to baseball (2.5"-3" diameter)
- **Areas Hit**: Eastern Georgetown (Wolf Ranch, Teravista, Serenada)
- **Insurance Claims Filed**: 2,000+
- **Average Claim Payout**: $16,000-$26,000
- **Outcome**: Significant property damage, many roofs totaled

**May 2019 Hailstorm**
- **Hail Size**: Softball-sized (4"+ in some areas)
- **Areas Hit**: Wolf Ranch, western Georgetown
- **Insurance Claims Filed**: 1,800+
- **Average Claim Payout**: $18,000-$30,000
- **Outcome**: Extensive damage to newer homes

**February 2021 Ice Storm** (Winter Storm Uri)
- **Event**: Statewide catastrophe, ice dams, structural damage
- **Areas Hit**: All of Georgetown
- **Insurance Issues**: Mixed coverage (some policies excluded ice damage)
- **Complications**: Power outages prevented tarping, damage worsened

**The Pattern**: Georgetown gets hit by major hail every 1-2 years. If you haven't filed a claim recently, you likely have hidden damage that insurance will cover.

### Georgetown Neighborhoods Most Affected

**Highest Risk Areas**:
- **Sun City Texas**: Wide-open terrain, minimal tree protection, elevated locations
- **Westview**: Hilltop exposure catches direct storm paths
- **Wolf Ranch**: Master-planned community, new construction vulnerable to hail
- **Berry Creek**: Elevated lots, open development
- **Serenada**: Northwest Georgetown, direct Temple-to-Austin storm corridor
- **Historic Downtown**: Older roofs more susceptible to wind/hail damage

**Why This Matters for Claims**: If your neighbors filed claims, your roof likely has similar damage—even if you don't see obvious problems from the ground. Sun City in particular saw thousands of claims after March 2023.

## What Georgetown Insurance Companies Actually Cover

### Covered Perils (What They WILL Pay For)

✅ **Hail Damage**
- Granule loss exposing asphalt substrate
- Fractured or cracked shingles
- Bruised/dented shingles (functional damage)
- Damaged flashing, vents, gutters, downspouts
- Broken roof penetrations (skylights, pipe boots)
- Tile damage (common in Sun City—cracks, chips, broken tiles)

✅ **Wind Damage**
- Missing shingles from high winds (Georgetown's 50-80 mph thunderstorms)
- Lifted or curled shingles
- Torn or displaced flashing
- Damaged underlayment exposure
- Blown-off ridge caps

✅ **Combined Storm Damage**
- Hail + wind in same storm event
- Fallen tree limbs from severe weather
- Debris impact during storms
- Ice dam damage (from winter storms like Uri)

✅ **Full Replacement When**:
- Damage exceeds 40% of roof (most policies)
- Matching shingles/tiles unavailable (discontinued colors/styles)
- Structural damage to decking
- Multiple storm events create cumulative damage

### NOT Covered (What They WON'T Pay For)

❌ **Normal Wear and Tear**
- Age-related deterioration (common in Sun City's 15-25 year old roofs)
- UV degradation over time
- Granule loss from normal weathering
- Manufacturing defects (file with manufacturer, not insurance)

❌ **Pre-Existing Damage**
- Damage from storms BEFORE your policy started
- Prior damage you didn't report
- Neglected repairs from past storms

❌ **Maintenance Issues**
- Lack of preventive maintenance
- Clogged gutters causing water damage
- Poor ventilation leading to premature failure
- DIY repairs done incorrectly

❌ **Cosmetic Damage Only** (Some Policies)
- **CRITICAL**: Some Georgetown policies have "cosmetic damage exclusions"
- Means hail dents that don't affect function may not be covered
- Check your policy declarations page
- Most Georgetown homeowners DON'T have these exclusions (but verify)

### Georgetown-Specific Policy Considerations

**Typical Georgetown Deductibles**:
- **Percentage-Based**: 1-2% of dwelling coverage
  - $250,000 home (common in Sun City) = $2,500-$5,000 deductible
  - $350,000 home (Wolf Ranch average) = $3,500-$7,000 deductible
  - $500,000+ home (Berry Creek estates) = $5,000-$10,000 deductible
- **Flat Deductible**: $2,500-$5,000 (less common)
- **Separate Wind/Hail**: Sometimes higher deductible just for wind/hail (check policy)

**Sun City Specific Considerations**:
- Many retirees on fixed incomes—deductibles are significant expense
- Age 55+ discounts available with some insurers (AARP, USAA)
- Some insurers specialize in retirement communities
- HOA architectural standards may affect coverage (approved materials)

**Historic District Considerations**:
- Higher replacement costs (specialized materials required)
- Agreed value policies recommended (full replacement regardless of age)
- Document historical details before storms
- May need specialized coverage for authentic materials

**Replacement Cost Value (RCV) vs Actual Cash Value (ACV)**:
- **RCV**: Insurance pays full replacement cost (what most Georgetown policies have)
  - Example: New roof costs $17,000, you pay $3,000 deductible, insurance pays $14,000
- **ACV**: Insurance pays depreciated value (rare but check your policy—some Sun City retirees have ACV)
  - Example: 18-year-old roof worth $9,000 depreciated, insurance pays $6,000 after deductible
  - You're stuck with $11,000 out-of-pocket

**How Payment Works**:
1. **Initial Payment (ACV)**: Insurance pays depreciated amount upfront
   - Example: $17,000 claim, 25% depreciation = $12,750 initial check
2. **Final Payment (Recoverable Depreciation)**: After work completed, you submit invoice
   - Example: Submit $17,000 invoice, insurance pays remaining $4,250
3. **You Pay**: Your deductible ($3,000) at time of work completion

## Step-by-Step: Filing Your Georgetown Insurance Claim

### Step 1: Document Damage (First 48 Hours)

**Immediate Actions**:

**📸 Take Comprehensive Photos**:
- **From ground level** (DO NOT climb on roof—safety + liability)
- **All angles**: Front, back, sides, every elevation
- **Close-ups**: Dented gutters, damaged vents, window screens
- **Hail on ground**: If storm just passed, photograph hail with ruler/quarter for size reference
- **Neighboring damage**: Other Sun City/Wolf Ranch homes with visible damage (strengthens "storm pattern" claim)
- **Interior damage**: Water stains, ceiling damage, attic leaks
- **Tile roofs** (common in Sun City): Photograph cracked, chipped, or broken tiles

**📝 Document Storm Details**:
- **Date and time** of hail event
- **Hail size** (check National Weather Service storm reports for Georgetown)
- **Save weather reports**: Screenshot/print National Weather Service data showing hail in Georgetown/Williamson County
- **News coverage**: KVUE, KXAN local news coverage of the storm
- **Neighbors**: Note if neighbors are filing claims (Sun City saw 1,000+ claims after March 2023)

**🔍 Quick Self-Inspection**:
- Look for dented gutters/downspouts
- Check AC unit for hail dents
- Examine window screens for holes
- Look for damaged siding
- Check fence/deck for impact marks
- Sun City: Inspect tile roofs for visible cracks from ground

**Georgetown Pro Tip**: After major hailstorms (like March 2023), Sun City and Wolf Ranch get flooded with insurance adjusters AND storm chasers. File within 7 days to avoid backlog delays.

### Step 2: Contact Your Insurance Company (Within 7 Days)

**Make the Call**:

**📞 What to Say**:
- "I need to file a claim for roof damage from the [DATE] hailstorm in Georgetown"
- "My address is [STREET], Georgetown, TX [ZIP—78626, 78628, 78633]"
- "I have photos documenting damage to my roof, gutters, and property"
- "I'd like to schedule an adjuster inspection as soon as possible"

**📋 Information You'll Need**:
- Policy number
- Date of loss (storm date)
- Description of damage
- Contact information
- Preferred adjuster appointment times (Sun City retirees: daytime works well)

**✅ Get This Information**:
- **Claim number** (write it down immediately)
- **Adjuster name and contact info**
- **Inspection timeline** (usually 3-14 days; longer after major storms)
- **Your deductible amount** (confirm percentage vs flat fee)
- **Coverage details** (RCV vs ACV, any exclusions)

**⚠️ What NOT to Say**:
- ❌ "I'm not sure if there's damage" (sounds uncertain)
- ❌ "My roof is 18 years old anyway" (gives them excuse to deny—Sun City homeowners, beware!)
- ❌ "This happened a few months ago" (delayed reporting = red flag)
- ❌ Accept blame: "I should've maintained better" (admission of neglect)

### Step 3: Get Professional Inspection (Within 2 Weeks)

**Why You NEED a Contractor Inspection**:

Insurance adjusters work for the insurance company—their job is to minimize payouts. A professional roofing contractor works for YOU and finds ALL damage.

**What We Find That Adjusters "Miss"**:
- ✅ **Hidden hail impacts** on back slopes adjuster didn't photograph
- ✅ **Damaged decking** underneath shingles/tiles
- ✅ **Compromised flashing** around chimneys and valleys
- ✅ **Granule loss patterns** indicating functional damage
- ✅ **Damaged ridge vents and penetrations**
- ✅ **Bruised shingles** that will fail prematurely
- ✅ **Code violations** requiring upgrades (must be covered)
- ✅ **Tile damage** (Sun City): Cracked underlayment, broken batten strips

**Our Free Inspection Includes**:
1. **Complete roof assessment** (all slopes, penetrations, flashing)
2. **Thermal imaging** (detects hidden moisture from leaks)
3. **Drone photography** (comprehensive damage documentation)
4. **Written damage report** with photos
5. **Scope of work** (what needs repair/replacement)
6. **Detailed estimate** (itemized costs for insurance)
7. **Insurance meeting attendance** (we meet with your adjuster)

**Georgetown Contractor Selection**:

✅ **Choose Local, Established Contractors**:
- Permanent Georgetown/Austin office
- CertainTeed Shingle Master or GAF Master Elite certified
- BBB A+ rating with local references
- Licensed/insured in Texas (verify TDLR license)
- Experienced with Georgetown insurance adjusters
- Familiar with Sun City HOA requirements
- Experience with historic district approvals (if applicable)

❌ **AVOID Storm Chasers**:
- Out-of-state license plates (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana)
- Door-knocking within days of storm (FLOODED Sun City after March 2023)
- High-pressure "sign today" tactics
- Offering to "waive your deductible" (ILLEGAL insurance fraud)
- No local office/references
- Asking you to sign insurance check over to them
- Demanding payment before adjuster inspection

**Georgetown Storm Chaser Warning**: After the March 2023 hailstorm, Sun City was INUNDATED with door-knockers. Many Sun City retirees fell victim to scams—contractors disappeared after deposits, did shoddy work, or committed insurance fraud that voided coverage. Wolf Ranch and Berry Creek also targeted.

### Step 4: Meet the Insurance Adjuster (1-3 Weeks)

**Preparing for Adjuster Inspection**:

**📅 Schedule Strategically**:
- **Have YOUR contractor present** (levels the playing field—adjuster knows they can't lowball)
- **Mid-morning appointments** (9-11am—adjuster is fresh, not rushed)
- **Avoid Fridays** (adjusters rush to finish week)
- **Be present yourself** (shows you're engaged and watching)

**🏠 Property Preparation**:
- Clear driveway/yard access
- Unlock gates (common in Sun City, Wolf Ranch)
- Secure pets
- Have ladder accessible (if safe)
- Print your damage photos for reference
- Have National Weather Service storm report handy

**What Happens During Inspection**:

**Adjuster's Process** (30-90 minutes):
1. Introduction and claim number verification
2. Exterior walkthrough noting visible damage
3. Roof access via ladder or drone
4. Photographs/measurements of damaged areas
5. Interior inspection (if leaks reported)
6. Notes on roof age, condition, prior repairs
7. Verbal assessment (often minimizing damage)

**Your Role**:
- ✅ **Be Professional**: Friendly but businesslike (Sun City: hospitality is fine, but stay focused)
- ✅ **Point Out Damage**: "The contractor found damage on the back slope too"
- ✅ **Show Your Photos**: "Here's the hail on the ground that day"
- ✅ **Reference Neighbors**: "Ten homes on my Sun City street have filed claims"
- ✅ **Take Notes**: Write down what adjuster says
- ✅ **Get Timeline**: "When will I receive the estimate?"

**Common Georgetown Adjuster Tactics (And How to Counter)**:

❌ **Adjuster**: *"That's just normal granule loss from age."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"This happened during the [DATE] storm. Here's the National Weather Service report showing 2.5-inch hail in Georgetown that day. My contractor documented functional damage, not just cosmetic wear."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"Your roof is 18 years old, so we'll only pay depreciated value."* (Common in Sun City)  
✅ **Your Response**: *"My policy includes Replacement Cost Value coverage. Age doesn't matter when storm damage is the cause of loss. I expect full replacement cost minus deductible."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"I only see minor damage on the front slope. We'll approve a repair, not replacement."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"My contractor found damage on all slopes. Let's review the back slope together. Also, if matching shingles/tiles aren't available, the policy requires full replacement for aesthetic match."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"We need to see 8-10 hail impacts per 10x10 square for approval."*  
✅ **Your Response**: *"My policy doesn't state a specific threshold. Functional damage from even one impact per square can compromise the roof's integrity. Please document all impacts."*

❌ **Adjuster**: *"This looks like wear and tear, not storm damage."* (Often used on Sun City's older roofs)  
✅ **Your Response**: *"I can provide the exact storm date, weather service hail reports, and photos of neighboring properties with similar damage from the same event. This is clearly storm-related."*

**Georgetown Specific**: Georgetown adjusters are very familiar with Sun City claim patterns. If 20 homes on your street filed claims for the same storm, mention it—adjusters can't deny your claim if they approved similar damage next door.

### Step 5: Review the Adjuster's Estimate (7-14 Days)

**What You'll Receive**:

**Adjuster's Report Includes**:
- Scope of damage (what they agreed to cover)
- Line-item costs (materials, labor, permits, etc.)
- Total claim amount
- Depreciation amount (if applicable)
- Recoverable depreciation (paid after work completed)
- Your deductible
- Payment breakdown

**Example Georgetown Claim Estimate**:

```
Total Roof Replacement Cost: $17,500
Less Depreciation (25%):     -$4,375
Actual Cash Value (ACV):     $13,125
Less Deductible (1%):        -$2,500
Initial Payment to You:      $10,625

After Work Completed:
Recoverable Depreciation:    +$4,375
Total You Receive:           $15,000
Your Out-of-Pocket:          $2,500 (deductible)
```

**Red Flags to Watch For**:

❌ **Estimate Too Low**:
- Compare to your contractor's estimate
- Georgetown average full replacement: $11,000-$22,000 depending on home size
- Sun City homes (1,500-2,500 sq ft): typically $12,000-$18,000
- Wolf Ranch homes (2,200-3,500 sq ft): typically $15,000-$25,000
- If adjuster says $7,000 for 2,000 sq ft home = WAY too low

❌ **Repair Instead of Replacement**:
- If damage covers >40% of roof, most policies require full replacement
- Partial repairs rarely work long-term in Georgetown's hail climate
- Matching discontinued shingles/tiles = impossible = full replacement required

❌ **Missing Items**:
- Did adjuster include damaged gutters, vents, flashing?
- Permit costs? (Georgetown building permits required)
- Dumpster/disposal fees?
- Decking repairs if needed?
- Waste factor (typically 10% for hips/valleys)?
- Sun City: Tile roofs have higher disposal costs—did adjuster account for this?

❌ **Undercounting Damage**:
- Did they measure entire roof or just one slope?
- Georgetown homes average 18-28 squares—does estimate match?
- Ask contractor to verify square footage

### Step 6: File a Supplement (If Needed)

**What is a Supplement?**

A supplement is additional documentation submitted when the adjuster's initial estimate missed damage or undervalued the claim.

**Common Reasons for Supplements in Georgetown**:

1. **Hidden Damage Discovered During Tearoff**:
   - Rotten decking underneath shingles/tiles
   - Water damage to underlayment
   - Damaged roof framing
   - Code violations requiring upgrades
   - Sun City tile roofs: Damaged batten strips, compromised underlayment

2. **Adjuster Missed Damage**:
   - Back slopes not inspected
   - Damage to outbuildings (garage, shed—common in Georgetown's larger lots)
   - Gutter/downspout replacement needed
   - Additional flashing/penetration damage

3. **Price Discrepancies**:
   - Adjuster used low-quality materials in estimate
   - Labor rates below Georgetown market rates
   - Didn't include waste factor or steep slope charges
   - Missed permit fees ($200-$350 in Georgetown)
   - Sun City: Underestimated tile disposal costs

**How to File Supplement**:

1. **Contractor Documents Additional Damage**:
   - Photos during tearoff showing hidden issues
   - Detailed notes on extent of damage
   - Revised scope of work
   - Updated estimate with line items

2. **Submit to Insurance**:
   - Email or fax to adjuster
   - Include claim number
   - Reference original estimate
   - Itemize NEW damage found
   - Provide supporting photos

3. **Adjuster Re-Inspects** (or approves remotely):
   - Usually 3-7 days for review
   - May require second site visit
   - Approval depends on documentation quality

4. **Revised Payment Issued**:
   - Supplemental payment covers additional approved items
   - Usually paid within 7-14 days of approval

**Georgetown Supplement Success Rate**: When properly documented with photos and expert contractor assessment, supplements in Georgetown have an 80-90% approval rate. Insurance companies know Sun City and Georgetown get hammered—if you provide proof, they usually pay.

### Step 7: Complete the Work and Collect Final Payment

**Timeline**:

1. **Receive ACV Payment** (initial check from insurance)
2. **Sign Contract with Contractor** (reputable Georgetown roofer)
3. **Work Scheduled** (typically 2-6 weeks out depending on season)
4. **Roof Replaced** (1-3 days for average Georgetown home; tile roofs may take 3-5 days)
5. **Final Inspection** (City of Georgetown inspection for permit compliance)
6. **Submit Invoice to Insurance** (contractor provides completed work invoice)
7. **Receive RCV Payment** (recoverable depreciation released)
8. **Pay Contractor Final Balance** (you pay deductible + any overages)

**Payment Best Practices**:

✅ **DO**:
- Wait for insurance approval before signing contracts
- Pay deductible at time of work completion (not before)
- Get lien waivers from contractor and all subcontractors
- Keep all invoices, receipts, permits, warranties
- Submit RCV claim with signed completion certificate

❌ **DON'T**:
- Sign insurance check over to contractor (you control funds)
- Pay full amount upfront (standard is 1/3 deposit, balance at completion)
- Skip city inspection (required for permit closure)
- Let contractor leave without final walkthrough
- Forget to get written warranty (materials + workmanship)

## Common Georgetown Claim Denials (And How to Fight Them)

### Denial Reason #1: "Pre-Existing Damage"

**What They Say**:  
*"This damage existed before the storm event. Claim denied."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Provide storm date and National Weather Service hail reports
- ✅ Show photos of neighbors' damage from same storm (Sun City group claims)
- ✅ Get expert opinion from contractor (letter stating damage is storm-related)
- ✅ Reference recent roof inspection (if you had one pre-storm showing no damage)
- ✅ Appeal with documentation proving damage timeline

**Georgetown Example**: After March 2023 hailstorm, some Sun City adjusters claimed damage was "from the 2021 storm." Homeowners fought back with photos taken AFTER 2021 storm showing no damage, plus weather service confirmation of March 2023 golf ball hail. Most denials overturned.

### Denial Reason #2: "Cosmetic Damage Only"

**What They Say**:  
*"We see hail dents, but they're cosmetic. Your policy excludes cosmetic damage."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Review your policy—most Georgetown homeowners DON'T have cosmetic exclusions
- ✅ Get contractor letter explaining functional damage (granule loss = shortened lifespan = functional)
- ✅ Document that matching shingles/tiles aren't available (aesthetic match impossible = functional issue)
- ✅ Cite Texas Insurance Code requirements for proper coverage

**Key Argument**: Hail damage that exposes asphalt substrate or fractures shingle seal strips is FUNCTIONAL damage, not cosmetic. For tile roofs (Sun City): Cracked tiles compromise waterproofing = functional.

### Denial Reason #3: "Roof Too Old / Normal Wear"

**What They Say**:  
*"Your roof is 18 years old. This is normal wear and tear, not storm damage."* (Very common in Sun City)

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Confirm you have RCV (Replacement Cost Value) coverage, not ACV
- ✅ RCV policies cover storm damage regardless of age
- ✅ Get before-and-after documentation (storm created NEW damage, not wear)
- ✅ Expert opinion: Contractor explains this is storm damage, not age-related failure
- ✅ Texas law: Age doesn't void coverage for covered perils

**Georgetown/Sun City Reality**: Many Sun City roofs are 15-25 years old (original construction 1999-2009). Age doesn't matter if you have RCV coverage and can prove storm damage.

### Denial Reason #4: "Not Enough Damage"

**What They Say**:  
*"We only found 4 hail impacts. Not enough to warrant replacement."*

**How to Fight It**:
- ✅ Your contractor likely found MORE damage (have them document every impact)
- ✅ Request adjuster re-inspect with YOUR contractor present
- ✅ Cite policy—most don't have "minimum impact" threshold
- ✅ Argue: Even limited impacts on critical areas (valleys, penetrations) = functional damage
- ✅ If shingles/tiles discontinued, entire roof must be replaced for match

**Counter-Argument**: "My policy doesn't specify a threshold for approval. Hail damage to ANY portion of the roof compromises its integrity and warranty. Additionally, matching my discontinued shingles/tiles for a partial repair is impossible, requiring full replacement per policy provisions."

## When to Hire a Public Adjuster in Georgetown

**What is a Public Adjuster?**

A licensed professional who represents YOU (not the insurance company) in negotiating your claim. They handle all paperwork, documentation, and negotiations for a percentage of your settlement (typically 10-15%).

**When to Consider Hiring One**:

✅ **Claim Denied Unfairly**:
- You have clear storm damage but claim denied
- Multiple appeals rejected
- Insurance acting in bad faith

✅ **Very Large Claim** ($30,000+):
- Complex damage (roof + interior + structure)
- Multiple structures (home + garage + fence—common on Georgetown's larger lots)
- 10-15% fee worth it for maximizing large payout

✅ **Time Constraints**:
- Sun City retirees traveling/snowbirding
- Don't have time for back-and-forth
- Want expert to handle everything

✅ **Lowball Settlement**:
- Adjuster offering $9,000 for damage contractor estimates at $18,000
- Negotiations stalled
- You need leverage

**When You DON'T Need One**:

❌ **Straightforward Claim**:
- Clear hail damage, no disputes
- Adjuster approved fair amount
- Just need contractor to do work

❌ **Small Claim** ($5,000-$10,000):
- 10-15% fee ($500-$1,500) not worth it
- You can handle yourself or with contractor help

❌ **Good Contractor Support**:
- Your roofer is experienced with claims
- They attend adjuster meeting
- They file supplements for you (often free service)

**Georgetown Public Adjusters** (If You Need One):
- Verify Texas Department of Insurance license
- Check BBB rating and Google reviews
- Get fee structure in writing (percentage vs flat fee)
- Understand what services included
- Ask for Georgetown/Sun City references

## Georgetown Insurance Claim Timeline & Expectations

**Typical Timeline** (Hail Damage Claim):

| Timeframe | Milestone |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Day 0** | Hailstorm hits Georgetown |
| **Days 1-7** | Document damage, call insurance, schedule contractor inspection |
| **Days 3-14** | Adjuster inspection scheduled |
| **Days 7-21** | Adjuster submits estimate |
| **Days 10-30** | Review estimate, file supplement if needed |
| **Days 21-45** | Claim approved, receive ACV payment |
| **Days 30-90** | Schedule and complete roof replacement |
| **Days 90-120** | Submit RCV claim, receive final payment |

**Total Time: 3-4 months from storm to final payment** (if no complications)

**Delays Common in Georgetown**:
- **After major storms**: When 3,000-5,000 claims filed simultaneously (like March 2023), adjuster visits delay 3-6 weeks
- **Sun City volume**: With 10,000+ homes, Sun City claims can overwhelm adjusters
- **Supplement negotiations**: Can add 2-4 weeks
- **Contractor availability**: Peak season (spring/summer after hail) = 4-8 week wait
- **Permit delays**: City of Georgetown inspections sometimes delayed during high-volume periods

## Maximizing Your Georgetown Claim Payout

### Strategy #1: Document Everything

📸 **Photo/Video Tips**:
- Take 100+ photos (more = better)
- Date/time stamp enabled
- Multiple angles of each damaged area
- Close-ups with ruler showing impact size
- Before-and-after comparisons (if available)
- Neighboring homes with visible damage (Sun City: photograph entire street if multiple claims)

### Strategy #2: Know Your Coverage

📋 **Review Your Policy**:
- Replacement Cost Value (RCV) vs Actual Cash Value (ACV)—critical for Sun City retirees
- Deductible amount (percentage or flat fee)
- Coverage limits (usually full replacement up to dwelling coverage)
- Exclusions (cosmetic damage clause? read carefully)
- Time limits for filing (usually 1 year, but file ASAP)

### Strategy #3: Use Local Expert Contractor

🏆 **Why Local Matters**:
- Familiar with Georgetown adjusters
- Knows Georgetown building codes
- References from Sun City, Wolf Ranch neighbors
- Permanent location (won't disappear)
- Experienced with Georgetown/Sun City HOA requirements
- Understands historic district procedures (if applicable)

### Strategy #4: Be Present and Engaged

👤 **Stay Involved**:
- Attend adjuster inspection
- Ask questions
- Take notes
- Review estimates carefully
- Follow up regularly
- Don't sign anything until you understand it

### Strategy #5: File Supplements Strategically

📝 **Additional Damage**:
- Hidden damage during tearoff
- Code upgrade requirements
- Additional structures (garage, shed)
- Interior damage (water stains, drywall)
- Gutters, downspouts, flashing

### Strategy #6: Don't Accept First Offer

💰 **Negotiate**:
- Compare adjuster estimate to contractor estimate
- Point out discrepancies
- Request re-inspection
- Provide additional documentation
- Be professional but firm

## Georgetown Claim Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Waiting Too Long to File

**The Problem**:
- Some policies have strict time limits (90 days to 1 year)
- Storm chasers move on, legitimate contractors get booked up
- Damage worsens over time (small leak becomes big problem)
- Evidence disappears (hail melts, neighbors fix roofs, photos lost)

**Georgetown Reality**: After March 2023 hailstorm, Sun City homeowners who waited 6+ months faced delays, contractor shortages, and tougher adjuster scrutiny.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Not Getting Professional Inspection

**The Problem**:
- You miss hidden damage
- Adjuster finds "nothing wrong" because you can't point out technical issues
- You accept lowball settlement not knowing true extent of damage
- Claim denied because "no damage found"

**Solution**: Free professional inspection from certified Georgetown roofer BEFORE adjuster visit.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Signing Insurance Check Over to Contractor

**The Problem**:
- You lose control of funds
- If contractor disappears, you have no leverage
- If dispute arises, you can't withhold payment
- Some contractors overcharge knowing they control money

**Proper Process**: Insurance check goes to YOU (or you + mortgage company). You pay contractor at milestones (deposit, completion).

### ❌ Mistake #4: Hiring Storm Chaser

**The Problem**:
- Shoddy work (they're gone before you notice)
- Insurance fraud (waiving deductible = illegal)
- No warranty support (can't find them later)
- Unlicensed/uninsured (liability falls on you)

**Georgetown Storm Chaser Red Flags**:
- Door-knocking immediately after storm (flooded Sun City after March 2023)
- Out-of-state plates (Oklahoma, Arkansas common)
- Pressure tactics: "Sign today or lose opportunity"
- "We'll waive your deductible" (ILLEGAL)
- No local office, P.O. box address
- Can't provide Georgetown/Sun City references

### ❌ Mistake #5: Accepting Repair When Replacement Needed

**The Problem**:
- Partial repair on damaged roof = band-aid
- Matching shingles/tiles often unavailable (aesthetics + warranty issues)
- Repaired section fails faster than rest of roof
- You pay deductible for temporary fix

**Georgetown Truth**: With hail damage to 40%+ of roof, replacement is almost always better long-term value.

### ❌ Mistake #6: Not Reading Settlement Before Signing

**The Problem**:
- You sign away rights to future claims on same damage
- You accept depreciation when you have RCV coverage
- You don't notice missing items or lowball pricing
- Release-of-liability clauses prevent supplements

**Always**:
- Read entire settlement document
- Compare to contractor estimate
- Ask questions about anything unclear
- Don't sign under pressure
- Consult contractor or attorney if uncertain

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long do I have to file a claim after a Georgetown hailstorm?**

Most policies allow 1 year from date of loss, but file within 7-14 days for best results. After major Georgetown hailstorms, adjusters get backlogged—early filing = faster service.

**Will my insurance rates go up if I file a claim?**

Typically no. Hail is a "no-fault" natural disaster. However, check with your agent. Filing multiple claims in 3-5 years MAY affect rates or insurability. But don't let fear of rate increases stop you from filing legitimate claims—that's why you pay premiums.

**What if my adjuster says I don't have enough damage?**

Request a second inspection with YOUR contractor present. Get written documentation from contractor. File a formal appeal with photos and expert opinion. If still denied unfairly, hire public adjuster or consult insurance attorney.

**Can I choose my own contractor, or do I have to use insurance company's preferred vendor?**

YOU choose your contractor. Insurance cannot require you to use their "preferred vendor" list. Those contractors may cut corners to meet insurance pricing. Choose based on quality, certifications (CertainTeed Shingle Master), and Georgetown reputation.

**I live in Sun City and my roof is 18 years old. Will insurance still pay?**

If you have Replacement Cost Value (RCV) coverage, yes. Age doesn't matter for storm damage claims. If you only have Actual Cash Value (ACV) coverage, they'll depreciate based on age. Check your policy declarations page—most Sun City homeowners have RCV.

**Should I tarp my roof after storm damage?**

If actively leaking, yes—temporary tarp prevents further damage. Save receipts (insurance may reimburse tarping costs). But don't attempt yourself—hire professional to avoid injury and liability.

**How much will my deductible be?**

Check your policy. Most Georgetown homeowners have 1-2% of dwelling coverage:
- $250,000 home (Sun City average) = $2,500-$5,000 deductible
- $350,000 home (Wolf Ranch average) = $3,500-$7,000 deductible

Some policies have flat deductibles ($2,500, $5,000). Separate wind/hail deductibles sometimes higher.

**What's the difference between ACV and RCV payments?**

- **ACV (Actual Cash Value)**: Depreciated amount paid upfront
- **RCV (Replacement Cost Value)**: Full replacement cost (ACV + recoverable depreciation paid after work completed)

Most Georgetown policies are RCV. You receive ACV initially, submit invoice after completion, receive remaining depreciation.

**Do Sun City HOA rules affect my insurance claim?**

Not directly. Insurance pays for what's damaged. However, HOA may require specific materials/colors for replacement. We handle HOA approvals—your insurance still pays for covered damage regardless of HOA requirements.

**Don't Let Insurance Companies Shortchange You**

Georgetown homeowners pay thousands in premiums every year. When hail destroys your roof, you deserve full coverage. With proper documentation, expert contractor support, and knowledge of your rights, you can maximize your claim and get the quality roof replacement you're entitled to.
