"Should I repair or replace my roof?"

It's one of the most consequential—and expensive—home maintenance decisions you'll face. Get it right, and you save thousands while protecting your home for decades. Get it wrong, and you either waste money on patchwork repairs for a dying roof or replace a roof that had years of life left.

The stakes are high: roof replacement costs $12,000-$25,000+ while repairs might be $500-$3,000. But spending $2,000 per year on recurring repairs for a roof that should have been replaced five years ago is the worst financial outcome.

This isn't a simple age-based decision. A 15-year-old roof might need replacement while a 20-year-old roof might be fine for five more years. It depends on damage type, extent, location, material quality, climate exposure, and your long-term plans.

This comprehensive guide provides a decision framework combining quantitative factors (age, cost, damage extent) with qualitative considerations (home plans, budget, risk tolerance). You'll learn the exact questions to ask, calculations to make, and red flags that demand immediate replacement—plus when repair is the smarter financial move.

## The Decision Framework Overview

**Five Critical Factors:**

1. **Age** (30% weight) - How old is the roof?
2. **Damage Extent** (30% weight) - Isolated or widespread?
3. **Cost Ratio** (20% weight) - Repair cost vs replacement cost
4. **Future Plans** (10% weight) - How long staying in home?
5. **Long-term Value** (10% weight) - What maximizes ROI?

**Scoring System:**

Each factor scores 0-10. Multiply by weight. Total score determines recommendation:

- **0-30 points:** REPAIR is clear choice
- **30-50 points:** BORDERLINE - Consider multiple factors
- **50-70 points:** REPLACEMENT likely best
- **70-100 points:** REPLACE immediately

**We'll walk through each factor with specific scoring guidance.**

## Factor 1: Roof Age (30% Weight)

### Understanding Roof Lifespans in Texas

**Standard Asphalt Shingles (3-Tab):**
- Rated lifespan: 20-25 years
- Texas reality: 15-20 years (heat accelerates aging)
- Replacement threshold: 15+ years

**Architectural/Dimensional Shingles:**
- Rated lifespan: 25-30 years
- Texas reality: 20-25 years
- Replacement threshold: 18+ years

**Class 4 Impact-Resistant Shingles:**
- Rated lifespan: 30 years
- Texas reality: 25-30 years (more durable)
- Replacement threshold: 22+ years

**Metal Roofing:**
- Rated lifespan: 40-70 years
- Texas reality: 40-60 years
- Replacement threshold: 35+ years

**Tile Roofing:**
- Rated lifespan: 50+ years
- Texas reality: 50+ years (excellent heat tolerance)
- Underlayment may need replacement before tiles

### Age-Based Scoring

**Score Calculation (0-10):**

- **0-5 years old:** Score = 0 (repair unless catastrophic damage)
- **5-10 years:** Score = 1 (repair almost always)
- **10-15 years:** Score = 3 (evaluate damage carefully)
- **15-18 years:** Score = 5 (borderline—depends on condition)
- **18-22 years:** Score = 7 (lean toward replacement)
- **22-25 years:** Score = 9 (replace unless budget constrained)
- **25+ years:** Score = 10 (replace immediately)

**Multiply score by 3.0 (30% weight)**

**Example:**
- Roof age: 17 years
- Base score: 6 (between 15-18 range)
- Weighted score: 6 × 3.0 = 18 points

### Age + Texas Climate Consideration

**Heat Accelerates Aging:**
- Subtract 3-5 years from rated lifespan
- 25-year shingles = 20-22 years in Texas
- South/west slopes age fastest (20-30% faster)

**Regional Variations:**

**Austin/San Antonio (Central Texas):**
- Extreme heat, moderate storms
- Expect 80-85% of rated lifespan

**Houston/Coastal:**
- High humidity, hurricanes
- Expect 75-80% of rated lifespan

**Dallas/Fort Worth:**
- Hail risk, temperature swings
- Expect 70-80% of rated lifespan

**Adjust scoring accordingly based on your specific conditions.**

## Factor 2: Damage Extent (30% Weight)

### Types of Damage

**Minor/Localized Damage (Score 0-2):**

✓ **Few missing/damaged shingles** (<5% of roof)  
✓ **Small leak in one area**  
✓ **Minor flashing issue**  
✓ **Isolated wind damage**  
✓ **Repairable puncture/hole**  

**Action:** Repair is appropriate. Cost-effective fix.

**Moderate Damage (Score 3-5):**

⚠️ **Multiple areas damaged** (5-20% of roof)  
⚠️ **Several leaks or recurring leak**  
⚠️ **Widespread granule loss** (one slope)  
⚠️ **Multiple shingles curling**  
⚠️ **Flashing failure in several locations**  

**Action:** Borderline. Calculate repair cost vs replacement.

**Extensive Damage (Score 6-8):**

❌ **Damage affecting 20-50% of roof**  
❌ **Multiple slopes compromised**  
❌ **Widespread curling or buckling**  
❌ **Significant granule loss** (multiple slopes)  
❌ **Structural concerns** (sagging)  
❌ **Multiple leaks in different areas**  

**Action:** Replacement likely more cost-effective.

**Catastrophic Damage (Score 9-10):**

🚨 **50%+ of roof damaged**  
🚨 **Severe storm damage** (hail, wind, tree)  
🚨 **Structural failure**  
🚨 **Multiple layers of roofing**  
🚨 **Wood rot extensive**  

**Action:** Replace immediately. Repair not viable.

### Damage Location Matters

**High-Priority Areas (Weight damage 1.5x):**

**Valleys:**
- Critical water channels
- Damage here = guaranteed leaks
- Expensive repair due to complexity
- Often indicates widespread issues

**Around Chimneys/Penetrations:**
- Complex flashing requirements
- Leak-prone areas
- Damage spreads to surrounding shingles
- Repair costs escalate quickly

**Lower Slopes (Near Eaves):**
- Ice dam damage (rare in Texas but happens)
- Water backup damage
- Underlayment may be compromised
- Foundation risk if leaking

**Low-Priority Areas:**

**Field Shingles (Main Roof Surface):**
- Isolated damage easily repaired
- Low cost to fix
- Doesn't indicate systemic issues

**Ridge Caps:**
- Common wind damage point
- Inexpensive repair
- Doesn't affect rest of roof

### Calculating Damage Extent Score

**Measurement Method:**

1. **Estimate % of roof damaged**
   - Walk around house, assess each slope
   - Photograph damage areas
   - Rough percentage sufficient

2. **Assign base score:**
   - 0-5% damaged: Score 1
   - 5-10%: Score 2
   - 10-20%: Score 4
   - 20-35%: Score 6
   - 35-50%: Score 8
   - 50%+: Score 10

3. **Adjust for location:**
   - Damage in critical areas: +1 to +2 points
   - Damage in low-priority areas: -1 point

4. **Multiply by 3.0 (30% weight)**

**Example:**
- Damage extent: 15% of roof (base score 4)
- Location: Includes valley damage (+1)
- Adjusted score: 5
- Weighted score: 5 × 3.0 = 15 points

## Factor 3: Cost Ratio (20% Weight)

### The 50% Rule of Thumb

**Traditional Guideline:**

"If repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost, replace instead of repair."

**Reasoning:**
- Repair buys limited time (2-5 years)
- Replacement lasts 20-30 years
- Economics favor replacement at 50% threshold

**Example:**
- Replacement cost: $15,000
- Repair quote: $8,000 (53% of replacement)
- **Recommendation:** Replace

### Calculating Cost Ratio Score

**Formula:**

Cost Ratio = (Repair Cost ÷ Replacement Cost) × 100

**Scoring:**

- **0-20% ratio:** Score = 0 (repair is obvious choice)
- **20-30%:** Score = 2 (repair makes sense)
- **30-40%:** Score = 4 (repair reasonable)
- **40-50%:** Score = 6 (borderline)
- **50-60%:** Score = 8 (lean toward replacement)
- **60%+ ratio:** Score = 10 (replace—repair not economical)

**Multiply by 2.0 (20% weight)**

**Example:**
- Repair quote: $4,500
- Replacement estimate: $14,000
- Cost ratio: ($4,500 ÷ $14,000) × 100 = 32%
- Base score: 4
- Weighted score: 4 × 2.0 = 8 points

### Get Accurate Estimates

**For Repairs:**
- Get 2-3 contractor quotes
- Specify exactly what needs fixing
- Ask about warranty on repairs
- Include any underlying damage (decking, etc.)

**For Replacement:**
- Get 3-5 estimates for comparison
- Specify similar materials (apples-to-apples)
- Include removal, disposal, permits
- Ask about financing options

### Hidden Cost Considerations

**Repair Costs Often Underestimated:**

**Once contractor opens roof, may find:**
- Decking rot (add $500-$2,000)
- Underlayment damage (add $500-$1,500)
- Additional shingle damage (add $300-$800)
- Fascia/soffit rot (add $1,000-$3,000)

**Factor in 20-30% contingency for repairs that expose hidden damage.**

**Replacement Costs More Predictable:**
- Complete tear-off exposes everything
- Quoted price closer to final
- Fewer surprises

### Recurring Repair Trap

**Scenario:**
- Year 1: Repair leak ($800)
- Year 2: Repair different leak ($1,200)
- Year 3: Repair storm damage ($1,500)
- Year 4: Multiple issues ($2,000)
- **Total over 4 years: $5,500**

**If replacement was $15,000:**
- Spent 37% of replacement cost already
- Still need replacement soon
- Wasted money

**Look back 3-5 years:**
- How much spent on repairs?
- Add to current repair quote
- Compare total to replacement cost

**If cumulative repairs exceed 40% of replacement, time to replace.**

## Factor 4: Future Plans (10% Weight)

### Time Horizon Matters

**Selling Soon (1-2 Years):**

**Considerations:**
- New roof = selling advantage
- ROI: 60-70% (typically)
- Buyers expect functional roof
- May prefer repair if roof has life left

**Scoring:**
- Selling within 1 year: Score = 7 (lean toward replacement)
- Selling 1-2 years: Score = 5 (borderline)
- Selling 3-5 years: Score = 3 (repair may suffice)

**Strategy:**
If roof 18+ years old and selling soon, replace—buyers expect it, adds value, avoids negotiation deductions.

**Staying Long-Term (5+ Years):**

**Considerations:**
- Full benefit of new roof
- No mid-ownership re-roof hassle
- Maximizes value to you
- Better economics for replacement

**Scoring:**
- Staying 10+ years: Score = 0 (repair if possible)
- Staying 5-10 years: Score = 2 (evaluate carefully)
- Staying 3-5 years: Score = 4 (borderline)

**Strategy:**
If staying long-term and roof has limited life, replace now—avoid disruption later.

**Uncertain Timeline:**

**Score = 5 (middle ground)**

**Strategy:**
- Err toward replacement if roof 18+ years
- Repair if roof under 15 years and damage minor

### Investment Recovery

**Replacement ROI (Selling Home):**
- Cost: $15,000 typical
- Increased sale price: $9,000-$12,000 (60-80%)
- Faster sale: Yes (buyers prefer new roof)
- Negotiation leverage: Strong

**Repair ROI (Selling Home):**
- Cost: $3,000 repair
- Increased sale price: $0-$1,000 (minimal)
- Disclosure: Must reveal previous leaks
- Inspection issues: Buyers may request replacement anyway

**For long-term owners:**
- Full lifespan benefit (20-30 years)
- Energy savings (better insulation, ventilation)
- Insurance benefits (lower premiums)
- Peace of mind

### Future Plans Scoring

**Calculate weighted score:**

Based on timeline, assign score (0-10), multiply by 1.0 (10% weight)

**Example:**
- Selling in 18 months
- Base score: 6
- Weighted score: 6 × 1.0 = 6 points

## Factor 5: Long-Term Value (10% Weight)

### Beyond Immediate Fix

**Repair Value Assessment:**

**Pros:**
- Lower upfront cost
- Solves immediate problem
- Buys time to save for replacement
- May be sufficient if roof young

**Cons:**
- Temporary solution (2-5 years typically)
- Doesn't address underlying aging
- May require additional repairs soon
- Limited warranty (1-5 years)

**Replacement Value Assessment:**

**Pros:**
- 20-30 year solution
- Addresses all issues simultaneously
- Improves energy efficiency
- Full warranty (20-30 years material, 5-10 years labor)
- Increases home value
- Better insurance rates possible

**Cons:**
- High upfront cost
- Disruption during installation
- May be overkill if damage minimal

### Energy Efficiency Gains

**New Roof Benefits:**

**Better Insulation:**
- Modern underlayment
- Proper ventilation installation
- Seals air leaks
- Reduces cooling costs 10-15%

**Reflective Shingles:**
- Higher SRI (Solar Reflectance Index)
- Reduces heat absorption
- Cooler attic = lower AC costs

**Annual Energy Savings:**
- Typical: $200-$400/year
- Over 25 years: $5,000-$10,000
- Offsets replacement cost significantly

**Repair:**
- No energy improvements
- Existing inefficiencies remain

### Insurance Considerations

**New Roof Benefits:**
- Reduced premiums (5-15% discount possible)
- Class 4 shingles = even greater discount (up to 20-35%)
- Easier claims approval
- Better coverage terms

**Old Roof Problems:**
- Higher premiums
- Limited coverage (ACV vs RCV)
- Claim denials for "wear and tear"
- May require replacement to maintain coverage

**Example:**
- Annual premium: $2,000
- New roof discount: 15% = $300/year saved
- Over 20 years: $6,000 saved
- Plus: better protection

### Warranty Protection

**Repair Warranty:**
- Workmanship: 1-5 years (typical)
- Materials: None (using existing aged shingles)
- Limited protection

**Replacement Warranty:**
- Shingles: 20-30 years (material defects)
- Workmanship: 5-10 years (installation)
- Enhanced warranties available (50-year lifetime)
- Transferable to new owner

**Value:**
- Peace of mind
- Protected investment
- Defects covered

### Long-Term Value Scoring

**Assign score 0-10:**

**Score 0-3:** Repair provides adequate value
- Roof young (under 12 years)
- Damage minimal
- Budget constrained
- Short timeline

**Score 4-6:** Value unclear
- Mid-life roof
- Moderate damage
- Mixed factors

**Score 7-10:** Replacement provides superior value
- Roof old (18+ years)
- Energy savings significant
- Insurance benefits meaningful
- Long-term ownership

**Multiply by 1.0 (10% weight)**

**Example:**
- Roof is 19 years old, energy savings substantial, staying 10+ years
- Score: 8
- Weighted: 8 × 1.0 = 8 points

## Decision Matrix: Putting It All Together

### Calculate Your Total Score

**Add up weighted scores from all five factors:**

1. **Age Score** (0-30 points)
2. **Damage Extent Score** (0-30 points)
3. **Cost Ratio Score** (0-20 points)
4. **Future Plans Score** (0-10 points)
5. **Long-Term Value Score** (0-10 points)

**TOTAL: 0-100 points**

### Interpretation

**0-30 Points: REPAIR**
- Clear choice
- Roof has substantial life left
- Damage isolated and repairable
- Cost-effective solution

**30-50 Points: BORDERLINE**
- No clear winner
- Consider personal factors more heavily
- Get multiple opinions
- Evaluate budget constraints
- May come down to risk tolerance

**50-70 Points: REPLACEMENT**
- Replacement likely better long-term
- Economics favor replacement
- Age and damage extent significant
- Consider financing if budget tight

**70-100 Points: REPLACE IMMEDIATELY**
- Overwhelming case for replacement
- Repair is throwing money away
- Safety/structural concerns possible
- Act quickly

### Example Calculation 1: Young Roof, Minor Damage

**Scenario:**
- Roof: 8 years old, architectural shingles
- Damage: 3 missing shingles from wind storm
- Repair cost: $400
- Replacement cost: $16,000
- Future: Staying 10+ years

**Scoring:**

1. **Age:** 8 years → Score 1 × 3.0 = **3 points**
2. **Damage:** 3 shingles (<1%) → Score 1 × 3.0 = **3 points**
3. **Cost Ratio:** $400/$16,000 = 2.5% → Score 0 × 2.0 = **0 points**
4. **Future Plans:** 10+ years → Score 0 × 1.0 = **0 points**
5. **Long-Term Value:** Young roof → Score 2 × 1.0 = **2 points**

**TOTAL: 8 points → REPAIR**

**Recommendation:** Repair is obvious choice. Roof has 15+ years of life left.

### Example Calculation 2: Old Roof, Widespread Damage

**Scenario:**
- Roof: 22 years old, 3-tab shingles
- Damage: Curling on 30% of roof, granule loss, several leaks
- Repair cost: $6,500
- Replacement cost: $14,000
- Future: Selling in 2 years

**Scoring:**

1. **Age:** 22 years → Score 9 × 3.0 = **27 points**
2. **Damage:** 30% damaged → Score 6 × 3.0 = **18 points**
3. **Cost Ratio:** $6,500/$14,000 = 46% → Score 6 × 2.0 = **12 points**
4. **Future Plans:** Selling 2 years → Score 6 × 1.0 = **6 points**
5. **Long-Term Value:** Energy/insurance benefits → Score 7 × 1.0 = **7 points**

**TOTAL: 70 points → REPLACE IMMEDIATELY**

**Recommendation:** Replace. Repair costs 46% of replacement, roof is 22 years old (past lifespan), damage widespread, and selling soon (new roof aids sale).

### Example Calculation 3: Borderline Case

**Scenario:**
- Roof: 16 years old, architectural shingles
- Damage: One valley leaking, 10% of surrounding shingles damaged
- Repair cost: $4,800
- Replacement cost: $15,500
- Future: Staying 5 years

**Scoring:**

1. **Age:** 16 years → Score 5 × 3.0 = **15 points**
2. **Damage:** 10% + valley → Score 4 × 3.0 = **12 points**
3. **Cost Ratio:** $4,800/$15,500 = 31% → Score 4 × 2.0 = **8 points**
4. **Future Plans:** 5 years → Score 3 × 1.0 = **3 points**
5. **Long-Term Value:** Mixed → Score 5 × 1.0 = **5 points**

**TOTAL: 43 points → BORDERLINE**

**Recommendation:** Depends on budget and risk tolerance. Repair buys 3-5 years but may need replacement within that window. Replacement avoids re-roofing disruption during 5-year occupancy. If budget allows, replacement slightly preferred. If tight budget, repair is reasonable.

## Special Circumstances

### Hail Damage (Insurance Claim)

**If Insurance Covering Replacement:**

**Considerations:**
- Out-of-pocket: Only deductible ($1,000-$2,500)
- Full replacement vs partial repair
- Matching issues if repair

**Recommendation:**
**Always choose replacement when insurance pays.** You're getting a $15,000-$20,000 roof for $1,000-$2,500. Economics overwhelmingly favor replacement.

**Pro Tip:** 
Insurance often requires matching, which is difficult with aged shingles. Use this to advocate for full replacement even if damage only partial.

### Multiple Layers Existing

**If Roof Already Has 2 Layers:**

**Code Issue:**
- Most codes prohibit 3+ layers
- Must tear off to add another layer
- Repair may be only option (until replacement)

**Considerations:**
- Extra weight on structure
- Harder to assess underlying damage
- Repair costs higher (working through layers)

**Recommendation:**
If 2 layers exist and significant damage, must replace with full tear-off. Cannot add another layer. Budget for complete removal.

### Historic Home

**Preservation Considerations:**

**Requirements:**
- May need to match original materials
- Historic district approval
- Specialized contractors
- Higher costs

**Repair vs Replace:**
- Preservation usually favors repair when possible
- Replacement must match historic character
- Consult preservation officer

### Budget Constraints

**If Cannot Afford Replacement Currently:**

**Temporary Repair Strategy:**

1. **Prioritize critical leaks** (prevent structural damage)
2. **Address safety hazards** immediately
3. **Plan for replacement** (save monthly)
4. **Monitor condition** carefully
5. **Consider financing** options

**Financing for Replacement:**
- Home equity loan: 4-7% interest
- Personal loan: 7-15% interest
- Contractor financing: 0-12% (varies)
- Credit card: 15-25% (last resort)

**Monthly payment comparison:**
- $15,000 @ 6% for 7 years = $225/month
- Often less than recurring repair costs

### Selling "As-Is"

**If Not Repairing/Replacing Before Sale:**

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- Must disclose known roof issues
- Inspection will reveal problems
- Buyers will negotiate heavily

**Price Impact:**
- Expect $10,000-$20,000 reduction
- Buyers factor in replacement cost
- May lose qualified buyers (FHA loans require functional roof)

**Recommendation:**
Unless severe budget constraint, better to replace and sell with new roof—nets higher sale price and faster sale.

## The Final Decision: Repair or Replace?

### Use This Simple Checklist

**Choose REPAIR if most of these are TRUE:**

✓ Roof is under 15 years old  
✓ Damage affects less than 10% of roof  
✓ Repair costs under 30% of replacement  
✓ No structural concerns  
✓ Recent repairs have been minimal  
✓ Not selling home soon  
✓ Total score under 35 points  

**Choose REPLACEMENT if most of these are TRUE:**

✓ Roof is 18+ years old  
✓ Damage affects 20%+ of roof  
✓ Repair costs exceed 50% of replacement  
✓ Multiple leaks or recurring issues  
✓ Significant repairs in past 3 years  
✓ Selling home within 2 years  
✓ Insurance benefits meaningful (Class 4 discount)  
✓ Total score over 50 points  

### When in Doubt, Get Professional Assessment

**Hire Roofer for Inspection:**
- Cost: $150-$300
- Detailed condition report
- Photo documentation
- Repair estimate vs replacement estimate
- Lifespan prediction

**Benefits:**
- Expert eyes see what you might miss
- Uncovers hidden damage
- Provides documentation for decision
- Peace of mind

**Ask Specific Questions:**
- "What's the remaining lifespan?"
- "Will repair solve the problem long-term?"
- "Are there other issues I'm not seeing?"
- "What would you do if this was your house?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Endless Repairs on Dying Roof

**Trap:**
- Year after year of "just one more repair"
- Each repair $500-$2,000
- Never addressing underlying aging

**Reality:**
- Old roof = recurring problems
- Spending $5,000-$10,000 over 3-5 years
- Still need replacement eventually

**Solution:**
Look at cumulative repair spend. If approaching 40-50% of replacement cost, stop repairing and replace.

### Mistake 2: Replacing Perfectly Good Roof

**Trap:**
- Minor damage prompts replacement talk
- Contractor upsells unnecessarily
- Spending $15,000 when $800 repair suffices

**Reality:**
- Young roof with isolated damage is repairable
- Replacement not needed for 10+ years

**Solution:**
Get second opinion if contractor recommends replacement on roof under 12 years old with minor damage.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Hidden Damage

**Trap:**
- Focus only on visible shingles
- Don't check attic or decking
- Choose repair without full assessment

**Reality:**
- Water damage spreads unseen
- Decking rot requires replacement regardless
- "Repair" becomes full replacement mid-project

**Solution:**
Thorough inspection including attic before deciding. Factor hidden damage into decision.

### Mistake 4: Cheapest Bid Wins

**Trap:**
- Get three quotes, choose lowest
- Don't compare scope or quality
- Assume all replacement similar

**Reality:**
- Low bids cut corners (thin materials, poor installation, no warranty)
- Quality varies dramatically
- Cheap roof fails early

**Solution:**
Compare scope, materials, warranties. Choose best value, not lowest price. A $12,000 quality roof beats a $9,000 cheap one.

### Mistake 5: Delaying Obvious Replacement

**Trap:**
- Roof is 25 years old, clearly failing
- "Just one more year" mentality
- Hope it lasts until more convenient

**Reality:**
- Catastrophic failure = emergency replacement
- Higher cost (3x normal) for emergency
- Interior damage from leaks ($5,000-$20,000+)

**Solution:**
If roof past expected lifespan, replace proactively on YOUR timeline, not roof's.

## Financing Your Decision

### Repair Financing (Under $5,000)

**Options:**

**Personal Savings:**
- Best option if available
- No interest, no debt

**Credit Card:**
- 0% intro APR cards
- Pay off within promo period
- Avoid interest

**Contractor Financing:**
- Some offer for larger repairs
- Check terms carefully

### Replacement Financing ($12,000-$25,000)

**Best Options:**

**1. Home Equity Loan/HELOC:**
- Interest rate: 4-7%
- Term: 5-15 years
- Interest may be tax-deductible
- Secured by home

**2. FHA 203(k) Renovation Loan:**
- For major repairs/replacement
- Low down payment
- Includes in mortgage refinance

**3. Contractor Financing:**
- Many roofing companies offer
- 0% for 12-24 months (sometimes)
- Check for deferred interest traps

**4. Personal Loan:**
- Unsecured
- 7-15% interest
- 3-7 year term
- Fast approval

**5. Savings (Save First):**
- Plan replacement 1-2 years out
- Save $1,000-$1,500/month
- No interest paid
- Best if roof can wait

### Insurance Coverage

**When Insurance May Cover:**

**Full Replacement:**
- Hail damage
- Wind damage (tornado, hurricane)
- Fire
- Fallen tree

**Typical Deductible:** $1,000-$2,500

**What Insurance Doesn't Cover:**
- Normal wear and tear
- Age-related deterioration
- Lack of maintenance
- Cosmetic issues

**Filing Claim:**
1. Document damage immediately (photos)
2. Contact insurance within 48-72 hours
3. Get roofing contractor assessment
4. File claim with documentation
5. Adjuster inspects
6. Approval (or denial)
7. Proceed with work

**Important:**
If insurance pays for replacement, ALWAYS choose replacement over repair. You're getting $18,000 roof for $1,500 deductible—economically obvious.

## Your Action Plan

### Step 1: Gather Information (This Week)

□ **Determine roof age** (build date, remodel records, seller disclosure)  
□ **Assess visible damage** (walk around, photograph)  
□ **Check attic for leaks** (stains, daylight, moisture)  
□ **Review repair history** (past 5 years)  
□ **Calculate cumulative repair spend**  

### Step 2: Get Professional Assessments (Next 1-2 Weeks)

□ **Schedule inspections with 2-3 roofing contractors**  
□ **Request detailed condition report**  
□ **Get repair estimate (itemized)**

□ **Cost ratio score** (repair ÷ replacement)  
□ **Future plans score** (timeline)  
□ **Long-term value score** (benefits)  
□ **TOTAL SCORE** (add weighted scores)  

### Step 4: Make Decision (Following Week)

**If Score 0-30 (Repair):**
- Get 2-3 repair quotes
- Choose reputable contractor
- Verify warranty
