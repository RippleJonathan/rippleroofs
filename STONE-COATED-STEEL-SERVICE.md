## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Service Page Matters

**Market Opportunity:**
- **Premium Product**: $18,000-$35,000+ per installation (vs. $12,000-$20,000 asphalt)
- **Higher Margins**: 15-20% better profit per job
- **Luxury Target**: Temple Wildflower, Leander Crystal Falls, Georgetown luxury neighborhoods
- **50+ Year Lifespan**: Ultimate value proposition for long-term homeowners
- **HOA Compliant**: Addresses major concern for luxury neighborhoods

**Content Gap Identified:**
- ✅ **Existing**: 4 blog posts (informational intent)
  - stone-coated-steel-vs-asphalt-shingles-texas.mdx
  - stone-coated-steel-roofing-texas.mdx
  - stone-coated-steel-roof-cost-texas.mdx
  - stone-coated-steel-hoa-approval-texas.mdx
- ❌ **Missing**: Dedicated service page (commercial intent)
- **Result**: Lost high-value conversions from ready buyers

**SEO Opportunity - Missing Keywords:**
- "stone coated steel roofing Round Rock" (local + commercial)
- "stone coated steel roofing installation" (commercial)
- "stone coated metal roofing contractor" (high intent)
- "stone coated steel roof cost" (pricing + commercial)

### Competitive Advantage

**Most Central Texas Roofers:**
- Offer stone-coated steel but hide it on generic metal roofing page

**Ripple Roofs with Dedicated Page:**
- ✅ Clear premium product positioning
- ✅ Addresses HOA concerns (links to existing blog)
- ✅ Transparent pricing transparency ($18k-$35k+ range)
- ✅ Educational + sales approach
- ✅ Authority positioning for luxury market
